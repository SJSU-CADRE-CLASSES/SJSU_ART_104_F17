Social Networking as software
   Social Networking has been existed for over two decades. While the function is significantly improved, the concept is the same.  Our society requires Facebook, Instagram or web services to survive. Sharing life experiences using video or animated GIF to friends is very common these days. Professor Joel Slayton had some first-hand experience with AOL and other early networking. 
   Social networking is a medium that allows average people to express their opinion. Joel Slayton believed that all social networking operation is software that has states and also a form of medium.  
   Now, the software is becoming thriving billionaires dollar web services. Without Facebook,  Millenials would be a social outcast. The software is integrated to our mind. 
The human inference with Facebook is awful. Facebook UI has been struck for most its existence.
Messenger service, which Facebook Answer to iMessage, is loosely connected to the main Facebook site.  
Joel Slayton mentioned that software can have multiple states. The integration of Facebook and Messenger service is quite incomplete.
Luckily, mini Messenger can be used while checking Facebook wall. On the other hand, stickers, gif and other multimedia features are pretty integrated.
Joel Slayton would never imagine that we can describe ourselves with selfies, short video, emoji, and stickers. Similarly, iMessage and other web-based communication use those elements. External factors cause differentiation on different services is blurred out. But the framework of Facebook and iMessage is quite different. For consumer, friends, and family will have the main reason to choose that particular services. 
   Internal influence of Facebook is the essential reason why they are profitable but also free to the consumer. 
   Some consumer doesn't enjoy it as much they used to be because of advertisement and sponsored content. 
   Users are bombarded with target content when they are using social networking.  However, it causes users to annoying. 
   Some people will pay for services to prevent Youtube to stop target advertisement. Professor Slayton didn't predict graph theory are used to make every user have their unique sponsor content.
