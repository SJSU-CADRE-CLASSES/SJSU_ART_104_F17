From my understanding FOAMSPACE is a mobile and temporary structural installation made possible by integrating bitcoin’s blockchain system. FOAMSPACE stimulates collaboration between the community and architects which in turn generates activity and adds value. 

The value of temporary architecture is that it generates a community, creates buzz and produces images that circulate like currency… The value and price of Foamspace Coin then became proportional to its salience, loaded with the realized installation and the installation yet to come.

As more people are engage with the installations then the more valueable FoamSpace coins becomes. I don’t think there was any mentioning of what the coins could be used for. I just implied that they could be used to purchase foam, pay fees, and pay for installation space. Collaboration between different profession is always good for growth, espesically when our population rate is increasing every year. New development in architecture designs is a must.   Another purpose of FoamSpace is to demonstrate the effectiveness of blockchain technology. From the reading it seems not many people are invested yet or even heard of blockchain. The project is still trying to grow.    

I had some questions while reading about FoamSpace. I like the idea that the foam is unaltered so it can be sold back to the manufacture but, with that said, does it mean architects are limited to the foams cubed structure? Would it matter if an artist were to alter the cubed shape foam to create something unique? 

This reading really stimulated my interest in blockchain technology. I never heard of blockchain before our discussion in class so I did a little research. I found a tedx talk giving an introduction to the technology and explaining its potentials.

I am still not convinced that blockchain is fail proof. There is always a chance that a person putting information onto the blockchain system can make a mistake. What if that input the wrong information to be distributed? If that does happen wouldn’t it mean the mistake would spread to every block in the system. Furthermore, when and if an error is spread across every block, how would it be fix because from my understanding change is immutable. I do see an array of applications that would benefit from blockchain technology: healthcare, real estate, charity, government, police, grocery stores, etc.
