## ART 104 - Reading 3

Blockchains are complex technologies that are becoming more and more useful in today's time. Despite their complexity, they are thought as being 2-dimensional. FOAM builds upon the existing ideas of blockchain but introducing a new "spacial dimension". In simple terms, FOAM stacks smart contracts on top of the system of x- and y-coordinates. FOAM sees its system being applied in various devices with negotiating capabilities, in supply chains, real estate and land ownership, AR, and more.

_Foamspace_ was an installation that focused on "the relationship between decentralized infrastructure and the production of the built environment"<sup>[[3]](#references)</sup> and the "impact of blockchain technology on the architect’s instruments of service"<sup>[[2]](#references)</sup>. The structures that make up the installation are made with geofoam—an extremely lightweight material—that are shaped into large 'blocks'. These blocks are publicly presented both individually and in groups that are lined up along the sidewalks, similar to the way blockchains function in our society today.
