Written by Ryan John King and Ekaterina Zavyalova, the article Value Slips Away centers around Foamspace, a temporary and mobile installation built for the 2015 IDEAS City Festival called The Invisible City. The concept of Foamspace is to focus on the relationship between decentralized infrastructure and production of the built environment. It was composed of large Polystyrene geofoam blocks, which represented a Bitcoin Blockchain, and stored Foamspace coins(digital currency) and the value generated during the festival. The coins were captured in a free digital wallet and these coins could be traded and tracked on a Bitcoin blockchain. Members were given a wallet when they joined.

The piece was installed on the Bowery in front of the New Museum, and it provided multiple spaces for participants to exchange value and it cultivated a community, creating an urban lounge.

Foamspace simulated how how a blockchain works physically. A blockchain records all activity on its network in chronological order, much like what was done with Foamspace. Every participate had access to it and if something were to change, everyone would be updated on that change. One thing I liked about this piece was that everyone who participated were instantly involved at they moment they joined and how everyone could see how much each participate had, emphasizing the idea of community. Even without knowing what Bitcoins or blockchains were, the participants could still be involved.
