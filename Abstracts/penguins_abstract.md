Modern technology has become one of the fundamental things in our daily lives. But how much does it consume our lives? 
No matter where we go, we will constantly see people on their phones, not for texting or calling, but instead socializing 
on social media. Additionally, we also see advertisements for new phones, computers, and new technologies that manipulate us.

Nowadays, people rely a lot on technology; it changes the ways we communicate with each other and the way we behave towards 
society. Do we use technology as a mean to escape reality? What could be the consequences that may happen in the nearly future?
