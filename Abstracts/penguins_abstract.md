media, users can make a living based on the content the user provides. Monetization through out the web has become a common method
for a lot of people to make easy money. It has been used in online news, Youtube videos and even in Facebook pages, some have even 
made monetization a actual career. While monetizing content does provide easy access to content and may even entertainment, it also
