Abstract:The current climate conditions require environmental sustainability implementations. Because changes cannot be implemented instantaneously in a short period of time, both the designers and AI will have to approach the issues in a periodical method: Artificial Intelligence could provide models and simulation, and designers will refine solutions based on the results and further research into the matter. With the aide of Blockchain technology, artificial intelligenceâ€™s data collection and analysis will accelerate, and solution implementation will aid in environmental sustainability.
