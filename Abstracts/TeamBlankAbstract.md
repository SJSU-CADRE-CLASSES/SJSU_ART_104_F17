The current climate patterns changed drastically over the past few years. For instance, summer temperature in Europe increased incrementally since year 2000, and its still going up (Lett). With temperature changes, the natural environment is prone to respond such as weather pattern shifts, storms, and so forth. World leaders are pushing sustainable design solutions more and more. This process can be significantly accelerated through blockchain technology.

Blockchain Technology is a new form of decentralized information technology that can be applicable to many situations beyond beyond cryptocurrency and financial assets; it can be used in various applications, including design practices. Blockchain technology opens up a platform for more collaboration, information sharing, and trackability (Swan); it is beneficial for designers because they can expand off previous data and analysis, and update other collaborators on their advancements as well. In addition, blockchain’s data and analysis distributive ability will be beneficial for Artificial Intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence aims to replicate human behavior like identifying and solving tractable information processing problems (Marr). Although Artificial Intelligence is an extension to human cognitive, they are backed by computational power; they can process everything more efficiently than humans can. In addition, Artificial Intelligence can run simulations and model to aid in various applications (Wiederhold). Especially in the design process, utilizing Artificial Intelligence to run simulations on real-world model is beneficial to designers because they can analyze and build solutions from the information, and further expand their research.

With Blockchain technology, designers have access to various sources of data to implement into their Artificial Intelligence or simulation programs. The Artificial Intelligence will take care of the simulations, and generate new data; designers can take various approaches based on the data produced, and distribute it to organizations that are aiming to achieve the same objective
