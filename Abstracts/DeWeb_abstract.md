  A Three.js Website for Switch ver.2
</p>
With the modern day 3D technologies, we wanted to update the previous site to a more 3D look. Using Three.js, we tried to develop a inactive 3D simulated site with a friendly user interface for the essays to be post upon. It is only fitting for today's technology with the slick interface of iPhones and Android OSs. We used multiple programs like Blender, Threejs Editor, Threejs Background, their examples, and Youtube tutorials by CJ Gammon. After all of that, the final product seems un-utilized potential and poor to say the least. It looked like a 1990's website with 2000's 3D models at the top. We could not fully grasp the concept of Javascript coding to bring this to the next levels. The inactive 3D site was our goal but we bit off too much then we could handle. The 3D website just seems underwhelming.
