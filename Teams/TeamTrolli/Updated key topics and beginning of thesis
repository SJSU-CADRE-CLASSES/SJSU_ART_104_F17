This year’s election seems to have stirred up more than controversy. The number of hate crimes in the U.S. Has spiked by 20% since
this recent election. Among this is the rise of the alt-right, a group centered on far-right ideologies and stand for the idea of white 
nationalism. Recently they have gained large attention after an incident in Charlottesville, which resulted in the death of one individual.
The First Ammendment of the US Constitution protects freedom of speech, but shouldn’t there be a limit when speech incites
violent acts against others? The events that took place in Charlottesville were harsh reminders of this dangerous group and their 
true intentions. The Internet has allowed multiple platforms for the alt-right to come together (anonymous if they felt the need) on
platforms such as 4chan, reddit, daily stormer, alternative right, and breibart news. With the election of Trump, including his over the
top racist remarks, this as allowed the alt-right to push their harmful agenda/message/ideologies.
