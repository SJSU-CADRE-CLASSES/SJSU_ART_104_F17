### Improving AI through Blockchain and quantum mechanics

This experimental journal article is about the potential use of block-chain technology, combined with quantum mechanics, to better improve and control the advances in artificial intelligence. The aspects explore a brief history of important breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, address different issues and perspectives behind the idea of the singularity, and analyze the potential improvements of AI through block-chain technology and quantum mechanics/computers. This article will provide an overview of AI and how we could manage it through practical deployment of distributed databases like block-chain. We hope to provide a possible realistic approach towards security on singularity.
