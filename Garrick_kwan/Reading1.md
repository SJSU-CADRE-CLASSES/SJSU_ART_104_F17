Using Processing to produce drawings is godsend to me. Processing doesn't require me to have pencil and canvas to draw something. Using programming skills that I have, I can creating a masterpiece.
As I reading the article, I didn't know Processing to improve photos.I used the frameworks to produce intresting computer-aided drawing. I can't stand use pencil and skecth something.
Photos are consider to be realistic in most case. To use computer alogitherigm to improve photo is very common. Drawing lines and making it realistic with a photo is very hard. 
You cannot draw that photos using markers as this is hard to draw nicely. The product is very interesting. I got fooled by the item.
