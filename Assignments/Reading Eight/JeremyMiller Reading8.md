Reading Response 8

	Ms. Timofeeva starts the article by stating that nature is not thought. She states that when trying to thinking about thinking about it, it thus qualifies as materialism. Nature can be thought of in many different ways such as objectal, or subject and substance, or subject and object, or subject and thing. It can even be thought of as forms of life, and as bodies. Ms. Timofeeva then goes on to explain the way the world can be seen by interpreting the writing of Eugene Thacker in is book *In the Dust of This Planet.*

	Ms. Timofeeva goes on to explain that Eugene Thacker had three different views of the world. One of these views was the Earth, or the world-in-itself which explaines what the world would be by itself, maybe before humans. The second type of world is the World or the world-for-us, which details the world working for us by using natural resources and the environment to survive. The last world is the Planet or the world-without-us. This view of the world sees itself without human beings, and has a dystopian view and a darker outlook on the world. Ms. Timofeeva then goes on to explain that she thinks the theory of the three types of world can actually be seen as three concentric circles, with the smallest being the World (the world-for-us), the middle circle being the Earth (the world-in-itself) and the Planet(the world-without-us).

	Ms. Timofeeva then extrapolates on the words heimlich and unheimlich which mean canny and uncanny respectively. Both of these words originate from das Heim or the Home. This home is domesticated Earth. The unheimlich is defined by Freud as "...everything that ought to have remained secret and hidden but has come to light." These views of the natural versus maybe the unnatural express the unease we may feel and discoveries we may make that could be very alien to us.

	Another philosophical connection that Ms. Timofeeva makes is that of a conversation between Batallle and A.J. Ayer, which asks if the sun existed before humans. Bataille thought that the sun had to be perceived to exist, where Ayer thought the sun had always existed before us. This relates back to the title about oil and how it has always existed before us, but not before all life, as dinosaurs and living matter from millions of years ago had to decompose and create the oil.

	Ms. Timofeeva then states that oil is the new gold. Oil and blood share the organic compound porphyrin, which shows that oil as the blood of the earth is not just a metaphor. Ms. Timofeeva then goes on to relate oil to labor and the meaning of the color black in a capitalist society, which shows that the black is always used, when we treat it very greedily and use it to our advantage. We use oil to work for us, just as we used slaves from Africa to work on building America as we know today.
