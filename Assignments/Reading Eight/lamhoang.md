Ultra-Black: Towards a Materialist Theory of Oil

In the reading "Ultra-Black: Towards a Materialist Theory of Oil" Oxana Timo Feeva talks about Nature and Philosophy of how we see it and think about it. She talks about oil and how we must find alternatives to using oil, as it has repercussions to using and minning it. Althought we need oil is everyday products we must find alternatives in nature. She talks about materialism by comparing it to how humans use and see oil. She mentions nature of nature as it can be agential as it can been seen in different ways. 
 
 She talks about the philosophy in Eugene Thacker's book In the Dust of This Planet, he describes it as having "The word “world” has, according to Thacker, three different meanings. The first is the world-for-us, or simply the World; the second is the world-in-itself, or the Earth, and the third is the world-without-us, or the Planet." Oxana says she does not think that the world-for-us, the world-in-itself, and the world-without-us are not three separate entities. She imagines it as 3 concentric circles the smallest one being the world, the next one being the earth and the biggest being the planets. However they could all be the same size and occupy the same space.
   
   The first circle represents home to her where things are familiar and surrounded by our belongings, the second circle represents where animals and plants are without thinking and being thought about. She describes that how nature is its like there but sometimes we dont notice it because were in our own world. She then starts talking about other doors that lead towards greater outdoors where wild beast do not go or humans. Its populated by demons and dark forces, and hyperobjects, and other entities that, that cannot be explained rationally.
