<h1>Ultra-Black: Towards a materialist Theory of Oil </h1> <p>
	This was a difficult philosophical article about the value of oil to our planet to read. Oxana Timofeeva begins the article with two different types of materialism and what it means to the planet. I understood some aspects of what she wrote but it was difficult to understand. Timofeeva didn’t have a stand in going full materialism or minimalism. She over emphasized in large words to explain them. She then goes on to explain to us the 3 views of earth. I honestly didn’t understand this point at all. We have different names to reference our planet. World (with humans), Earth (for itself), and planet (without us) was what she mentioned. Going on forward, she finally mentioned about the oil at the very end… What a way to confuse us. The oil is like the life essence of the planet. The blood to be exact. Every day we suck the oil from the planet and clash with war over and over. At this point, we humans just sound like parasites. In fact, we probably are since we don’t currently help to benefit the earth in much ways. Whoever controls the oil wells also controls much of society because oil correlates to money in our currency. Timofeeva pushes on forward with the concept of money too. Money is no more than an applied concept. It is basically useless out of the main human society. This was just the bare bones of what I got out of this article.
