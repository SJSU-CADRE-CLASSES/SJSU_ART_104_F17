John Berger talked about the ways we view images today; more specifically the ways that technology changed the meanings in works of art. When Berger talked about works of art he refers to artwork done by past masters that’s been preserved in museums. He discussed the invention of the camera which changed what we see and how we see art. “A painting can only be in one place at one time.” The use of a camera allowed a painting to exist, as a reproduction of itself, to be viewed from anywhere around the world. Instead of traveling to a foreign country to look at some famous art piece I can easily look it up on google images and view it on my screen. Berger questioned an original artwork and its reproductions in terms of being genuine and valuable. “What are the meanings of the copies put in homes and how are they different from the original ones?” 

I do not know the meanings of the copies but they are different from the original in the sense that they remind us of the original. In some instances, the copies are used to recreate experiences. Furthermore, they can be manipulated in many ways. Some examples Berger Mentioned were simply adding movement and sound. The movement of the camera on an artwork can create a landscape feel. This reminded me of a music video I recently saw in one of my classes. It looked as if it was shot from a top view of a very long photo. The video began at one end and slowly moved to the other end. It was carefully edited to hide the process. It is a fact that sound changes the meaning of an image. I guess that is why silence is favored in most places where valuable art is held. Depending on the context in which that art was intended for, silence is probably the best way of connecting the present moment to the content being represented.   

One of the thing that I found interesting was when a group of children was asked to examined and discussed a painting. The way they deconstructed the painting and the associations made to Jesus was fascinating to me. They did not talk about it in terms of art but in term of their experience. They were also able to identify problems that the artist was dealing with at the time like gender/identity.
