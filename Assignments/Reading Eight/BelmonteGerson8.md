Our history shows the birth of certain philosophies in order to make sense of the world and of life itself. Nature can be found 
without thought and as the article states, it existed way before humans manipulated the essence of it and thought of it as if it was 
independent. The world in which we exist has attempted to explain itself as one that is here because of us or for us, in the name 
we have given it or simply by the planet that is a part of a universe along with others. At the end philosophy must endure. 

I had a few observations about the Oil mentioned in the article. Oil, as we know is exploited and we sometimes use the weight of these
philosophies to find a justification for our actions for it. We can say that if the planet is here for us then we should reap the goods 
it gives us to further our humanity and rationalize our actions for it, but at the cost of lives or dangerous feud across our world. 
I wonder if the author would have mentioned the connection of oil to the philosophies a bit more or if the Oil should had been a support
for these beliefs.
