It was tricky to summarize what Oxana Timofeeva was trying to say because she bounced around talking about money, capitalism, labour, and so forth. But eventually, Timofeeva came to the analogy of oil and human labor; both are exploited, and maximized by business practices. I thought Timofeeva’s oil and labor force comparison was spot on (but somewhat hard to interpret) because this is happening in the job market as we speak.
For example, if you were to examine the Bay Area’s job market, aside from the increased demands of programmers/coders, there are more applicants/candidates over job openings. Another example are creative jobs such as designers, animators, and artists; nearly half of the open position I have discovered are contract-based. If the labor pricing becomes more expensive, companies would outsource their project to overseas; other countries that would complete the task for significantly less. Essentially it gets to the point that employers have the freedom to select whoever they deem worthy, and can dispose the employee whenever they are not on top of their stuff; humans treating humans as form of exchange. I feel like we are further pushing ourselves in this direction without being aware of what is happening, and focusing mainly on surviving; and that factor is being used against us by the higher-ups.
