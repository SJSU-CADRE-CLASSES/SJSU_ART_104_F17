## ART 104 - Reading 8

In her essay, Timofeeva explains the idea of materialism by comparing it with the metaphor of how humans view oil. Just like how oil is seen as a black substance made from long-dead organisms and is dug up from the grounds to power our machines in order to sustain our daily lives, materialism similarly is about how objects start to dictate the way humans live their lives. The author brings up money as another example that illustrates how consumers are slaves in the world of capitalism. Timofeeva also talks about the three 'worlds' that humans perceive: the _world-for-us_ (the _World_), the _world-in-itself_ (the _Earth_), and the _world-without-us_ (the _Planet_). In this example, despite them all being the same physical object, our perceptions completely change depending on the physical phenomena that builds and constructs the worlds; in the _World_ it is humans, in the _Earth_ it is nature, and in the _Planet_ it is the supra-natural.

I found it interesting and easier to conceptualize what materialism is with the question that appeared several times throughout the essayâ€”which came first: oil (or any other material) or humans? Obviously, humans have existed for quite a long time and oil even longer, but from a materialistic perspective, oil (or any other material) exists only after it has been observed by the viewer. The problems lies, not in the object, but rather within us humans and in our fascination/obsession with such materials. Humans are foolish, selfish animals that fight for, exploit, feed off of precious, useful materials and will do anything to obtain it. At the end, Timofeeva compares workers, slaves, and oil and says they all have in common the fact that they are not only repressed but also oppressed and that they are exploited for the benefit of the society.

The reading was interesting, albeit confusing in certain areas, but I am curious to how this relates with the usual discussions we do during class, i.e. how materialism will relate with digital technologies. I believe our materialistic views can be seen through our reliance to the point of obsessions with smart devices. Money, soon or later, will eventually become completely digitized and our physical currencies may become of little or no monetary value. Nonetheless, they will continue to influence and control our lives as we humans will never stop consuming goods and services.
