## Reading 5

I think the reading starts out by bringing in an interesting quote about how we as poeple should never allow computers to make important 
decisions because computers will always lack human qualities such as compassion and wisdom. There is a distinction between decoding and 
choosing. Choosing is a product of judgement. The author later mentions two things: that the same person who said this had a fear of the 
internet and what it can bring, and that he or she is of the last generation to know of a world without the internet.
