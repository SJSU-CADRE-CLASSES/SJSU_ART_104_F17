Pretend to Be a Bot, Rehumanize the Web
with Sebastian Schmieg — Aug 22, 2017

  Space, Galaxies, consetellations, city skylines, cars, people, math, clothes, charts, memes, some of the few things that are shown
in the video. It could be symbolizing the thought process of a bot as it processes data on the internet.
This article focsues on the online digital market place, where people who do freelance work are open to accept various jobs from people
looking to outsource a job or to get work done. He talks about digital work being like a software, where you input data and expect results.
In this case the people doing these jobs could be considered a software as they are technically doing the same type of work and producing
the same results. Sebastion say's To me, it’s obviously important to make a distinction between software and people. However, in a 
planetary-scale computational system that is constantly optimizing itself toward efficiency and profitability, there is no need for that 
distinction. Some issues that come from being a software extention is that you could be fired very easily and discarded, and another person 
could fill your spot immediately.
he then talks about Lean platforms like fiverr and uber which are companies who provide the framework for the workers, the workers have to
take care of the rest on there end. Like marketing, planning, work hours, pricing, tools, healthcare, and training. They are essntially 
software extensions, serving entrepreneuers who reap the benefits.
Sebastian wants to basically see AI based on collaboration, on curiosity instead of surveillance , on fiction, on small data, on weird data,
and on ambiguity.
