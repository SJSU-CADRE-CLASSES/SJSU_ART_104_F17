## ART 104 - Reading 7

Studio Berlin interviews Sebastian Schmieg who made _I will Say Whatever You Want In Front of a Pizza_, a story narrated from the POV of a _bot_ (people working online who do repetitive jobs and get tired so they grasp for any available opportunities). The story itself is a video made with Prezi, just like the Singaporean teenage girl who made the Prezi slides for Trump. Schmieg refers to the bots—the digital workers—as 'software extensions', which basically are humans who perform functions just like how actual computers do, easily removable and discardable, and the work these extensions do (digital labor) are at the expenses of the extensions themselves. The Internet nowadays, as well as the emerging technologies today, take advantage of these software extensions, as seen with Uber and their drivers independent of the company and fiverr.com where online workers list their skills to earn cheap money.

The interviews continues with the topic moving on to machine learning and AI. The interviewer asks if machines and bots be artists, and Schmieg answers "no". I, as well as many others, believe machines and AI cannot be artist as they lack the one characteristic that makes humans humans—emotion. Humans make art for many reasons, but one reasons that drives all other reasons is emotion and the need to express it. We make art because we feel the urge to say something about something. Machines may be able to produce works that exhibit artistic qualities, but since they do and will not express the intentions behind the creation of that work it shall not be considered art. As Schmieg puts in his words, they don't have "any real authorship". Therefore, machines and bots cannot be artists. There will be no way for machines to plant Easter eggs in the works they produce.

The Internet and our advancing technologies are generating more and more gaps and cubicles for software extensions to fill. The world is and will continue be run both by computers and humans that act like computers. The author and Schmieg believes humans must continue to exhibit their human qualities in order to see a future where everything is automated and driven solely by bots who sit on their asses and fix their eyes on screens 24/7. There must always be the distinguishment between _play_ and _labor_.
