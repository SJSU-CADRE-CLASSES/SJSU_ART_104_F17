Pretend to Be a Bot, Rehumanize the Web, an interview with Net artist Sebastian Schmieg. Schmieg was asked a series of questions pertaining to his work and thoughts. The questions that stood out to me were about AI(Artificial Intelligence) being able to make art. Things get interesting when Schmieg gets a question mentioning artificial intelligence. I think with AI on digital labor as humans we will have time for ourselves and to pursue greater goals.

It was interesting to reading about Schmieg view on the question on AI having if the capabilities to make art. Schmig began work on neural networks, a computer system having its paradigm based on the human brain and nervous system. While working with neural networks, Schmig found out the algorithms behind AI. Schmieg provides on how it works, ”Feeding so-called »big data« into such an algorithm allows it to detect patterns, and then to learn concepts represented in the data.” More from Schmieg,“I started to work with neural networks, the algorithms behind so-called artificial intelligence, when I realized that this is how all this data being gathered can be made productive.” Furthermore, Schmieg see AI as a collective endeavor.

On AI having creative potential and the notion of ownership, Schmeig answers with a no, the reason being on how broadly AI works, “Then, it’s also a question about responsibility. How do you know what a system will produce? Ultimately, a machine or a bot just follows a set of rules or a certain trained behavior. Therefore, I would again say bots or machines do not have any real authorship.”
