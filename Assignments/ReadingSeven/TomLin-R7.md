Sebastian Schmieg’s Pretend to Be a Bot, Rehumanize the Web touches upon utilizing people as bots in various customer services/service provider. An example would be companies such as Fiverr and Uber recruiting people to provide services under their banner; through these service providing platforms, people seem to become commodified, and slowly robotizing humans. Schmieg provided a video of how people had to act as bots to handle customer service. Customers would think the responses are programmed, but some service providers actually hired people to emulate bot behavior for essential inquiries. I think these factors make the user's’ end to almost neglect the human element of the Fiverr or Uber. 

I discussed this topic with my friend on an occasional basis; my friend would see the pro-platforms because it is good for people making some side money, jumpstart their careers, or a go-to for service provider. I see both ends because of the various implications: I think service providing platforms are great in their own right because they provide opportunities for people to side hustle and so forth, but in the process, people start to treat other people as objects/services. It is funny because business oriented people forego social or ethical implications to maximize productivity etc. As for an artist and researcher, I see the pros and cons, and criticize these platforms.
