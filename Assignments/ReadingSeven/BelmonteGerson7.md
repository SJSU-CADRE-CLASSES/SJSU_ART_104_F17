Before reading the article, I decided to look at the videos and images provided on the article first. It all just seemed random and odd,
like almost all art does, until of course I read about the meaning behind it. Bots are computer programs that stimulates human activity
thus making it a thing of the future or even maybe one day a fully developed and operational form of Artificial Intelligence. 

We, in a way, have become bots in the way we communicate and interact with the world so much online. I thought it was really interesting
to think of the concept in if Facebook or Google should pay us? They make huge amounts of revenue because of us, its users. Without our
visits, companies wouldn’t want to advertise or make business through their portals, and without them they can’t make money. 
There is a kind of labor when we scroll down our friends posts of selfies and restaurants check-ins, when we search how to fix our laptops 
or we search to watch the latest trailer to the newest Star Wars film. We are bots working for these companies, and I thought the author
did a good job in illustrating the concept using the Fiverr website, in which one can offer a service and get paid for it, because it 
works as if people were hiring bots to do something since everything is just done virtually and digitally. 

With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence, and as the article asked as well, I wonder if in the near future there will actually be
bots that can do these tasks, like come up with different options of an architectural design with the most efficient ways of construction
in half the time that a human mind can.
