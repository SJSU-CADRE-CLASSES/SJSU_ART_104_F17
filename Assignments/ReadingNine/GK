BBC Way of Seeing is a wonderful series that talks about art and culture. Art is an expression of a person. It was used to be very expensive and privilege to have art in your home. Now, art is everywhere, and the value of art decreased. With digital media, art is a regular form of communication. 

The cost of artworks in the 18th century is three month of the average wage in a family. It is not affordable for an average joe. Now, digital art can be found online and can easily get licensed. The ownership of having an art piece is done. It is a not healthy market and leads to art as a commodity.


Talking about women's nude in the 70s was a very different concept. But John Berger nails it in fascination way. There is a reason why people love the body of women because noblemen would have to buy those paintings. Most men would found women attractive. As a straight guy, most of the paintings in the 19th century are amazing. She would have curvy hips and smooth skin. Of course, if I was a guy in that era, the society recommended me to date those type of women. Male nude is not a thing because women treated badly that time. Women are responsible for family affairs and provide support to her husband. Nowadays, male nude is popular because straight guys want to see an ideal male image. Gay men will wish to see the nude picture because they are attracted. Young adult girls enjoy men in swim briefs. It is the society that demands the image of nude. Human are mostly sexually being and have a protrait of nude lady in family room was a good taste before women movement. 
John Berger has a correct point. It is very decent to paint nude women. Today in America, it would be discouraging to take a photo of nude women. It is considered X-rated portraits because some groups like American Family Asscoiation think it has a sexual nature. We are disconnecting reality.
