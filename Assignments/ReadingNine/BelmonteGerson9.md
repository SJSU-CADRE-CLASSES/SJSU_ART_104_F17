The way we see things has changed. The camera changed how we look at things and allows us to look at objects or scences through a different perspective. Before an image showed a place of meaning, now, because of the distributionn of the images, the images show no place of meaning. You can see the icon image in your home, they no longer have to be approached but they come to you.

I found super interesting how some images have become mysterious again, not because of the representation or medium used, not even because of the beauty of the work, but because of its market value, and that value comes from the it being genuine or not. Paintings lost something when the camera made them reproductible, their originality. This makes me wonder if cameras werent here today, if the painting industry would be what it was still, or if there would have been a different way to reproduce the works. The music played in the background of a painting is shifts the mood or meaning of it based on what kind of music it is. This influences how we perceive paintings or drawings without conciousness of it sometimes. This practice is used in commercials nowadays, or in movies or even in our own daily lives. We can listen to a certain song or type of music and that can influence the mood or type of day we have. It is crazy how we can hack our brain to bring us the sensation of a feeling, and how reproduction has changed the game for the studio art world.
