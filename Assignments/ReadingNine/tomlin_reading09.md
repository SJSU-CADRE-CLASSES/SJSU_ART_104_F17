John Berger discussed in episode 1 and 2 about various factors of context of painting, how the invention of camera changed perspectives, and symbolism. The audience can be in one place, and the artwork can be in another place; and the camera aid in reproduction and distribution. But, the camera controls what is being recorded in its perspective, so the audience is seeing through their eyes. In the sense of European painting, we are seeing what the painters want us to see; women as the main symbolism. Berger discusses about how the men are surveyor and the women are surveyed, and their gestures were sexual. In the context of perspectives, we are seeing what the painter wanted to depict what women role was. I think this is important in today’s context because various media outlets can imply different narratives.

CNN, for example, is Pro-Democratic party, and will do what it takes to get their candidate of choice to become president. The same goes for Fox News Channel, but for the Republican Party. Both parties will feed to the audience on these: the candidate’s strengths, the opponent’s weaknesses, exaggeration, and so forth. I believe setting narratives is another factor to consider when discussing about perspectives because one subject can be recorded multiple factions, and be interpreted various ways.
