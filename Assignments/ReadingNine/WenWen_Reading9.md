In the series “Ways of Seeing,” John Berger explains different ways we see painting and other forms of art. He raises questions about the ideologies in visual images and covers topics such as the effects of photographic reproduction of classical oil paintings, the effects of nudity in classical paintings, and how advertising and publicity relate to European traditional paintings. 

In the first episode, John Berger discusses about the meanings of authentic paintings and how their meanings have been changed since the invention of the camera. He explains that the original meanings of paintings can be transmitted through different ways of reproduction. Even thought the images shown in this video are not the original paintings, Berger whats to demonstrate that “the most important thing about paintings themselves is that their images are silent and still.” However, the silence and stillness of paintings are very easy to be manipulated and transformed by using movement and sound, even more radically through film and television. The meaning of images can be easily changed according to what we see beside it or what comes after it. As each person has different perspective to interpret things, what we see and how we see from images today could be varied and inconstant. Like John Berger said in the video, the works of art have lost and gained as they become transmittable. 

In episode 2, John Berger talks about the role of women and men in painting and art. In the tradition of European painting, especially in the category of the nude oil painting, “women are subservient to men” and being seen as a sight. The nude is like an object, a dress with naked body, or a disguise that can not be discarded. In many paintings showed in the video, women are painted as naked, passive, and relaxed only to show a sign of their submission to men rather than the expression of there own feelings. Women in those oil paintings and photographs are being displayed toward the audience. They are like objects posed to meet the idealism of the spectator, the desire of the men who are looking at the images. John Berger shows the program to a group of women and asks about their thoughts on the questions raised in the program. The women discuss how they see the nude images and talk about the effects of the nude paintings on today’s value of beauty.
