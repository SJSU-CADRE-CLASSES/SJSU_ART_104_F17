## ART 104 - Reading 9

In the first episode of _Ways of Seeing_, host John Berger discusses how the meaning of images can be changed and be interpreted through many ways—reproduction methods, contextual elements, perspectives, and sounds. All works of art are bound to change and have different impacts on the viewer, and in the examples provided by the video series, even historical paintings by Caravaggio and Goya become ambiguous in their meanings. Those who reproduce images are able to arrange their meanings.

In Episode 2, Berger continues with the topic of the objectivity of nude figures and how they are and have come to be represented. As with the story of Adam and Eve and how they ate the apple from the Tree of Knowledge, "nakedness is created in the mind of the beholder" and "the nude implies an awareness of being seen by the spectator".

Episode 3 had been about the objects in artworks—_objets d'art_—with an emphasis on European paintings, depicting wealth and ownership, and how the depictions of those objects represent various values despite not being tangible. Paintings on canvas are especially able to make drawn objects much more realistic and physical in their appearances.

In Episode 4, Berger presents a series of images and ads from the modern world that reference older, classical European paintings. The way they are being presented both on site and through Berger's program convey different meanings, but the meaning is ultimately interpreted by the experience of the viewer. The following quote comes directly from this particular episode:

> _What happens in the dream is meant to happen to us._<br>
> _What happens out there happens to strangers whose fate is meant to be different from ours._

Because images can be manipulated and edited, they are able to present and appeal "alternative ways of life" that which the common viewer aspires to, or thinks can aspire to, but has not yet achieved; sometimes they may depict experiences that the viewer may never experience at all in his/her lifetime.
