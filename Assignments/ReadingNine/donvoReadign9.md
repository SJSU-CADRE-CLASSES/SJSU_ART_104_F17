<h1>John Berger / Ways of Seeing, Episode 1 (1972) </h1>
<p>
&nbsp In the first episode of John Berger's Ways of Seeing, Mr. Berger introduces us to the variety of different perspectives in seeing art. This could had been applied to life as well. People nowadays can be anywhere in the world and view certain art work or place on their mobile device. By doing this, the viewer can see the piece, but the viewer doesn’t see the actual piece. Berger argued that by doing this, it took away from the real piece of art. If you aren’t there in front of the piece, the impact is lessening. One cannot see the glory and craftmanship of such a thing. The replica cheapened the real deal. Photography, the internet, and replicas had done this to the classical art. Berger said that the meaning of seeing the piece is somewhat almost lost. The fakes somewhat carry some of the meaning though. The replicas or photos does send the viral value by letting the mass know of its existence. 
In more of an art sense, there are also different ways of seeing an art painting. Focusing like a camera viewing specific areas will change the thought or view of the piece. Like how if you were to zoom-in on a section with a dog. You would see nothing else but a dog. The viewer would then survey the area and make assumptions of the dog in being a proud brown dog or something. When the view is zoom-outed, the dog is beside its owner posing in a clown costume. Now the dog is a circus performing dog. Interesting happens when the whole picture is revealed. There is also film sequence, viewing with music and sound, and viewing with given information. Every one of these factors will change the deciding factor of the view. Same can be said about situations in today’s media of politics and the irrational mass of people.
