The video series "Ways of Seeing" explores a topic that I recently covered in one of my Art History class. The issue of familiarizing ourselves
with reproductions of famous art. From only seeing them on the internet and in text books we don't grow to appreciate them fully or as they should
be. We get to know images of the paintings but never the paiting itself. These art pieces, which should be seen in person, have their own presence. 
My teacher referred to it as "thing-ness". It had a sort of substance within itself that gets lost in its reproduction through images. We as viewers
don't get to see the brush strokes, appreciate its size, or any of the little subtleties that get to be enjoy or even noticed untill seeing it in person.
I particularly have noticed this when visiting SF Moma recently. There were many pieces their that I have studied and learned about but I never really
appreciated them as much as I did until I saw them in person. For example, Roy Lichtenstein's Figures With Sunset created in 1978. Seeing that piece 
in person created a whole new appreciation for it. It had this overwhelming presence to it due to its size; something that isn't appreciated untill seen 
in person. When viewing art through a computer, textbook, or picture your imagination is limited to seeing it only as big as to whats presented to you.
Unless they include within the image a person, or thing that would allow you to reference its scale, which more often doesn't happen.

I also enjoyed the bit where he mentioned the issue of women being nude in these paintings and its implications. He talks about how women were seen as 
objects compared to men. How men had to view them to be able to paint them. That creates this feeling of dominance, one over the other. It starts a
conversation of power and equality as well. It also becomes an issue of pleasure. These men enjoyed painting nude women for a sense of self gratification
it seems like.
