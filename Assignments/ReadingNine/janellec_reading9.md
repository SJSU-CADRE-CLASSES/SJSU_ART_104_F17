<p>There is a timeless relevance in the "Ways of Seeing"'s discussion of paintings -- or more accurately, our perception of painting.
 The first episode takes on the subject of reproduction, as it affects and morphs the meaning of a piece.  Berger states that the monetary "value" assigned
 to a piece of art, usually as "a preservation of history and culture", simply replaces what is stripped of the original artwork once
 it is reproduced.</p>
 
<p>"Reproductions distort. Only a few don't."</p>

<p>The experience, the location, and the existence of the painted canvas -- this entirety is the original "meaning" of the work.
 When it is manipulated by the camera, it can be cropped, zoomed, and even altered. The power of the camera is its ability to guide
 a viewer's eyes and mind. In the context of painting and art, it brings up a very controversial ability to edit. Just showing one part of an
 entire piece can, and often will, change its meaning, just as being able to view the piece accompanied by outer elements such as sound and familiar objects.</p>
 
<p>The next two episodes discussed the subjects portrayed in paintings themselves, and I felt that they were cimportantly connected
 in theme. Berger focused on the portrayal and perception of the female nude in the second episode. The portrayal of the "nude" is innately linked to those
 who want to and will see it. Berger's separation of nakedness and the nude is important for defining the "nude";
 the idea that a nude is viewed as an object made to be viewed was thought invoking. I am not a fan of art history, and as a result I do not usually
 view historical art for its depictions as much as I do for its "title, artist, century, and location". But I'm starting to understand that there
 is a relevance and historical precendent found in the older paintings that I, as an artist, should be willingly aware of and confront.</p>
<p> Women, wives, and what they wear or do not wear, are considered belongings in the same sense as the jewels, clothing, and treasures.
 To have belongings depicted in painting is to depict their status, wealth, and legacy. It "immortalized" their wealth and image,
 and acted as another belonging in itself, another form of proof that they were wealthy or powerful.
