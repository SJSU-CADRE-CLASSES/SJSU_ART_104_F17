In the video “John Berger / Ways of Seeing , Episode 1 (1972)” the host John Berger talks about perspective in paintings. 
According to him when someone looks at a painting it, our eyes tend to look at one meaning. In addition, the paintings we see 
will eventually, be images we are familiar with in our daily lives. What doesn’t help is that famous paintings and art are now 
being reproduced by different companies for money. As a result, we are fully exposed to the image without seeing it in its display 
area. Paintings are now shown through the screens of computers, postcards and other ways they are reproduced. The meanings of the 
paintings become so transparent to our eyes, because we have seen it so many times while not personally seeing it up close. They 
have instead become information, objects to use.

Berger argues the looking at the original pieces still have a different meaning and experience to them. He believes the each 
painting carries great details and provides a different perspective when seeing it up close and personal.  
The paintings can provide different meanings when looking at the brush strokes and in silence. Our eyes usually play 
tricks on us whenever we view something. It all depends on where the painting is shown and where what exactly is shown 
besides it. Paintings can make several different perspectives and meanings, depending on the viewer. It can be transmitted 
through time for many years. The images can be engraved into our minds because of its narrative and motion that the artist has 
implanted in the strokes.  

Art in itself is very subjective; almost everything can have its own meaning and narrative to it. Like Berger said it really 
depends on who’s looking at it and our knowledge of the piece. Meanwhile our experience of the piece all depends on its exposure 
to us in the form of reprints. However, reprinting does help transfer the image and information about the painting without 
actually making the person travel. As he describes it paintings have become transferable thanks to all the reprints and being 
able to see the work through technology. I don’t find anything wrong with the reprints, but I do agree that being exposed to 
the work in its rawest from definitely heightens the experiences of seeing it. Paintings these days are so easy to find now, 
that we sometimes forget its true meaning of the work. However, meanings and narratives can be decipher in many ways as long as 
we keep an open mind about it.
