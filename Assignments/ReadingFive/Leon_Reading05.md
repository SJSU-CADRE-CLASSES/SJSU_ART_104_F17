In Identify Yourself by Krystal South, she explains the shifts and concepts that changed both the internet and its user.  I started reading Krystal’s article as a critical piece than of an artwork, but as I continued to read it felt like an artwork. Her experience of having an internet identity was similar to mines, most of my life spent looking at a screen chatting with friends. Reading about the process of an internet identity and how computers shaped our cognitive process. Brings up a question where is the internet going to in 10 to 20 and how will it affect the identities of humans.

	
“These digital networks have not only transformed our societal structure, they have also re-shaped our internal selves.” South writes. Growing up as an millenium, decades of exposure of the internet shaped most of my life. Many concepts that related to me were: The Quick Addiction, Internet Presence, To Speak, The Public Veil, Life=Game, and the Public Persona. To begin with the quick addiction, growing up with the internet did made me impatient and data hungry. This made me reflect back to J.C.R Licklider statement of how computer data and the human brain are both conjoined. “Man-computer symbiosis … will make very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership not too many years human brain and computing archives will be coupled together very tightly.” Too tightly, I think. Back to what South’s stated, “Our informational experiences are mediated by machines that have changed both the structure of our society and the way we think.”  Having an internet presence was a bit awkward – beginning with having a Myspace account – process. To lie about my user information. Long yearly periods of online gaming has shaped my public persona and my understanding of the way I see reality: Life=Game.

“The identity of the chat user could be formed on the fly, with 	separate names and logins to form different identities ...The practice of verbalizing your identity in text, rather than speech, surely changed the way that many computer users thought about themselves. One could expose only the positive aspects of one’s personality or only the negative, forgetting to mention spouses or children or parents, slightly changing your own age, appearance, etc.”

Connecting with other people's virtual identity with my own in online games make it easier for me to speak. Speaking through the internet and away from the keyboard felt different. Outside of the screen with a short to long conversation then saying bye, while in the screen conversations can last a long time.
 

As for the complexity in identity on the internet. Generally, I think it will be quite different, with the rate of how things are progressing. Such as virtual reality: people are able to access a spatial area and to see and speak with one another, just like a casual meet up physically.
