## ART 104 - Reading 5

In her long essay, Krystal South discusses about the identity of the self (ourselves) in the Digital Age, specifically on the Internet. The Internet is a powerful and useful technology made by humans, but it must be used cautiously. Information found on the web, including the supposed identities of users, is not all true, accurate, or verifiable. The openness of the Internet is what helps keep it moving forward, but at the same time that is what can make it unsafe for users.

South continues in her essay by talking about what identity is in this era of technological advancements. In the real world, people use legal documents—driver's licenses, ID cards, birth certificates, etc.—to prove that they are, in fact, themselves and only themselves. We express our thoughts and feelings with our senses: talking and listening to each other, observing facial expressions, touching and making physical contact. In the digital world, i.e. on the Internet via our devices, it is our choice to express our beliefs and opinions through the images we project ourselves as, such as SNS account profiles, or completely anonymously. The results differ.

Our reliance on the devices, both handheld and desktop, have drastically changed our lifestyles. Just like how the bicycle filled the 'power' gap and made traveling easier and much more efficient, the Internet had filled the 'distance' gap by making humans connect with other humans across the globe. However, the distance between user and device has also largely decreased, literally and physically. We let ourselves be interrupted by the never-ending notifications received on our phones. Once focused on the tiny screens, we dive into that world and that world only. It is embarrassing to admit that is it hard to imagine a world without the digital technology we have today.
