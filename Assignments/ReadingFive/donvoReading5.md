	I first want to talk about “identity” section and not about “yourself” part of the section because this is what I read first. The article begins off talking about human choices versus AI’s logical actions. We humans identify ourselves through the choices and path we make and the history of experiences that comes with it. But now in this modern age, computer and the internet are combined with us. Krystal said that your online profile or internet self is also who you are. You are forever bonded to your internet self whether online or offline. Besides that, most of us have computers now. In any case, the phone companies forces them smartphones with data plans. There is no escape. Unless you are anti-machinery and live in a rural area. I agree with this.
	Krystal South also talked about “Alternate Identities” of people on the internet. This is where people roleplay as a fictional character or someone else online other than themselves. I on the other hand believe that these so called alts are also apart of people because pretending who you are adds to who you are as a person. A internet troll is person who likes to mess with online chat rooms for their own satisfaction. A online user pretending to have the glamorous life or trying to be someone else wants to be someone else and not themselves due to personal reasons. Maybe they are in a investigation of sort. Who knows?
