 In Krystal South’s article “Identify Yourself”, she discusses her relationship with the emerging technology such as computers, the internet, online games, etc. When comparing an artificial intelligence versus a human, despite the infinite possibilities a computer can be programmed to go, human intelligence overpowers those capabilities. She argues that humans are capable of choice and making judgements based on history, society, and emotions. It’s non mathematical and beyond the grasp of computers. 

However, she also states that technology has supplemented her identity, and she is ‘half-machine’. Her argument stems from how with the help of the internet and social media, her person is laid out bare online for everyone to see. Because of that, the internet is human in a sense because it encompasses her identity. 

As an artist, we are told to think about the medium we wish to work in. In my sculpture class, we were to create a piece using found objects. It was not just figuring out what you were going to use as your found object, it was deciding what found object would be the best material to convey your message. The content and the meaning of your sculpture is presented through the material we chose, and if the medium did not relate to your message, the argument was lost. That's how I see South’s argument.

She is the message and the internet is the medium. People see us through our online persona. What we post about or how we conduct ourselves on sites such as Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat, tell the people who are looking at it who we are. People are not looking at the real or physical us when they look at our online profile, they are seeing a version of ourselves that we want people to see. 

As for me, I don't go on social media as myself very often. When I'm on sites such as Tumblr, YouTube, DeviantArt, or play online games, I go by a fake username. Under a name where I don't need to share my personal or private life, I can be goofy or outspoken without any restraint. Even if this is not the usual shy and quiet me, this persona is still part of my identity. It's the digital version of me that is intangible but ever present while I am in that space. Even if I don't go on some of those sites anymore, my profile and past activity are still there for anyone to see. 

Technology has also affected us physically. Our slouched bodies and our improved hand-eye coordination are products of the technological devices at our disposal. Technology as integrated in our minds and body language.
