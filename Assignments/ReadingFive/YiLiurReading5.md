I really love the website! It offers us a full freedom to get infomation. Every part of it is just dependent but related. Whenever you check a certain one of them, The contexts related (from the left/right colmn or the pictures in the mid) are always lay in the mid of the screen that you can reach. You can just remember what's the colmens mainly about then the informations will flows into your mind. I like this way of getting information. I personally call it--"peers reading"( I made this word, which means when you read a general topic that has many equal level of subtopics, you can start with whatever you want with your own understanding.)  I hope she could show an indext to the audience to tell us a new concept of reading though.At the beginning it might be a little big confusing but I think once we get familiar with it, it will be an effective way to get information, like we get information from multiple medias by using our fragment time.

WOW, this is so interesting. I think I will use it as my final topic.

Back to what I got in this article, a different identity sometmes is an accidental result for me. As a forigner I'm kind of acting as a different identity in this country. I hava difficulties on talking--Because I'm scared somehow talk in English in public, in the class my classmates might think I am a silence person because I never talk. But some classmates I added on text or social medias, they consider me as an super active person. Because via those texts I can easily express myself and never need to worry about my weird pronoucasions which might cause confusing. And it also gives me some spaces to compose my grammar. So, this is what I am thinking about: As those people who have difficulties in talking or speaking out, (e.g. too shy/autism .etc) they might represent a very different personality on the internet.

The website is mainly about the process of froming your identity via a virtual enviornment and how the virtual identity finally influenceyour identity in real.
