In today’s world, information is literally available to anyone and at any time. I remember growing up and having my mom buy me and my sisters these full encyclopedias from topics from space to history, etc. We needed these to go to when we didn’t understand a part of our homework or we didn’t know a concept. Now we have the internet, and South’s article goes about the lives we now live through the internet.

We as a society live in a microwave instant world, where the minute we wait for something, it all falls apart for us. In this case technology and the Internet. We depend so much on it that consuming all the information obtained from social media, news, videos etc can be rapidly replacing our need for physical and real objects, including our identity.

South mentions how in this technological world we live in now, differs from the one where we must use legal documents like driver's licenses, birth certificates, ID cards etc to prove who we are and that only we are uniquely that person. In an artificial world like the internet, we express who we are, not through feelings or our attitude tones or contact, but through our religion check in boxes or the articles we choose to endorse in our walls or the emojis we place after we write a sassy response. It’s a different according to what you want to project. 

South brings up just how much of us we are living online. She mentions creating a whole new identity of who we are online. Sometimes the online person seems just as important as the one offline. And we let so much acceptance come from online sources and people that don’t even know us that if we don’t get their acceptance, we’ll then die from their rejection. The computer, social media and the internet have become an extension of who we are and this is dangerous.
