## Reading 5 
*** 
I think the reading starts out by bringing in an interesting quote about how we as people should never allow computers to make important 
decisions; computers will always lack human qualities such as compassion and wisdom. There is a distinction between decoding and 
choosing. Choosing is a product of judgement. Krystal South later mentions two things. That the man she quoted, Joseph Weizenbaum, was
" a man afraid of teh technology he helped to create.", and that she was a part of the last generation that would evern know a world 
without the internet. 

I think that is an important thing to think through. That every generation from here on out will never know a life without the internet. 
Will they share the sentiments of the late Weizenbaum? Will they question the value of judgement that is put forth by a computer? While
what he said currently holds many truths, what about in the future? Would it be possible, for artifical technology to gain those qualities 
that were only thought to be belonged to humans? Will then, would we be able to allow them to make important decisions? I think those are 
interesting questions because as of right now, the possibilites are limitless. With the sudden rise of technology and how fast it has
gained momentum anything is possible. 

We are already living lives that are only possible through the invention of the computer and internet. It has become an essential part of 
everday life; from communication, logistics, trade, and even many jobs, all would have not been possible if we didn't have the internet. I 
think this is part of what Krystal South is saying in her article. She brings up the fact that you can create an identity for yourself
online. You can live a life online totally seperate and different from your offline self. The computer and our onlines selves have become just as important as our actual selves. They are bascally an extension of us. The computer, a lifeless machine, is something 
that we as people have decided to have thiss ultimate impact in out life. How far would we let it invade into our life though? Would we be able to ever allow or machines to make important decisions for us?
