I found the article readings interesting. Foamspace using blockchain. After the readings this opened me up the functions and implementations of blockchain even more. I also thought the material of choice was interesting; geofoam blocks, allowing  a visual metaphor for the bitcoin(cryptocurrency) blockchain. Foamspace approached the architectural community using a megastructure, built with geofoam, to set forth a dialogue of the influences of blockchain technology on the instruments to the architects. 

Foamspace used blockchain, while reading about this I had a hard time trying to grasp the how Foamspace used blockchain model for their project. Foamspace first made an app so users could store their Foamspace coin similar function as to bitcoin. A festival was held so then users then could install actual foam called geofoam into urban communities. This lead to the creation of many structures, which became urban hangout areas. The structures were built by the use of a spatial dimension where in the users could place geofoam in an longitude and latitude on a single horizontal layer, but they could access the vertical Z-axis; allowing users to place blocks of foam on top of one another.

Foamspace questioned the architectural community with the value of structures with colleration to the value of currency. My thoughts about of Foamspace was that they were trying to show the creative functions of blockchain.
