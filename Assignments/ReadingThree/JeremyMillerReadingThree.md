With FOAM, bitcoin becomes physical, without existing in purely a digital realm. Interestingly, with the the Expanded Polystyrene blocks, the actual blocks of a block chain become solid objects instead of a concept. When the blocks were sold, they were also sold for real money, so the cryptocurrency became physical cash. The same type of conceptual digital to physical also took place with the Tropical Mining Station, where mining computers produced heat and air, which was then collected to create a pneumatic space. With the added addition of FoamSpace Coins, the physical and digital were literally combined. 

Block chain technology can be used for so many applications, it boggles the mind. While the base use is as a form of tracking transactions and creating a system that is near impossible to  modify, the different blocks in a block chain can pertain to many aspects of a system. The blocks can relate to transactions, or pertain to qualities of an item being traded, or even contain code themselves and produce more information or run programs. Many of the apps made with block chain are related to tracking, the technology can replicate an A.I. system or provide information for self driving cars trying to locate directions or a destination. With the type of project that FOAM is, the possibilities and uses for block chain are expanding, and the true potential for block chain is being recognized even more than before.
