<p>The idea of creating an installation piece based on blockchaining was interesting, and is an example of 
the growing influence of interdisciplinary arts and concepts in modern day culture. Foamspace is definitely 
an eyeopener, as I would not usually think of implementing blockchaining into art. The result was an unbelievable
 geofoam environment which created its own temporary community and image circulation system. It is not only a
 successful experiment in architecture, but in building upon an art piece as a "currency". It is still hard for me to fully understand
 the process behind creating Foamspace and its Foamspace coin system, but the effiency and effectiveness of the
 system is apparent to me.
 </p>
<p>What I am curious about is whether Foamspace's main focus what the creation of the architecture/community, or
 featuring (possibly just experimenting a 'What if?') the use of blockchaining in a creative outlet. As I am
 currently taking ART103 with Steve Durie, we have also have many discussions of what a system is, how how art
 is or can be treated as a system. Foamspace and our 103 topics seem related to each other, and it is interesting
 seeing a more 'literal' application/process of an artist group using art as a system (or a system as art?).
 </p>
<p>I hope that more systems such as Foamspace is emerge with the increasing demand and debatably necessity for secure
 systems, and ways of exposing others to these systems. A great next step would be to dive deeper into this experiment
 by integrating smart contracts into a new installation/ art system, as the pool of possibilities in observing emergent and chaotic behavior from the widespread usage of these systems
 would not only be useful for the users of blockchaining, but could lead to a complex, almost "living" art system. It is similar
 to the wave of crowdsourced projects that began in the early 2000s.
