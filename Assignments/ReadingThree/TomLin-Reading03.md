Ryan John King and Ekaterina Zavyalova’s article, Value Slips Away, discussed about Foamspace: a temporary and mobile installation built for the 2015 IDEAS City hosted by the New Museum of Contemporary Art. Foamspace utilized Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) blocks for visual metaphor for Blockchain Technology because it can be found anywhere, but we cannot see it; EPS is commonly used in urban projects, and buildings. Foamspace’s EPS blocks were unaltered so they could be sold back to the supplier on the secondary-use market; this action also serves as a metaphor on how people exchange services for bitcoins, and so forth. Foamspace’s also allowed audience to interact with each other to simulate the Blockchain technology’s openness the public.
I believe that Foamspace is a near-exemplary representation of how Blockchain technology functions because of it is accessible to anyone, or everyone that has a computer and internet connectivity. I would even go as far to say that Foamspace was a physical manifestation of the internet because people are literally interacting with one another, but we just put minimal awareness on it; in essence, Foamspace points out that a lot of things are happening in the background. I am fascinated with Blockchain’s claim of failsafe because If I ever lose my data from one source, a previous version of my data may be available somewhere out there that I may be able to access.
