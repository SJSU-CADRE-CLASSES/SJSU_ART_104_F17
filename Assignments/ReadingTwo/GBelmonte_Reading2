I selected 2 readings from the website. One was under the Virtual Reality category, while the other one was under the 
Artificial Life heading. Linda Jacobson was interviewed about her writting about VR and about her work playing in a band that
would incorporate interactive visuals in their performances. She also helped different companies and schools around the 
Bay Area understand VR. It's interesting to see that VR had to be explained and there was a lot of excitement for it just as 
much as there is now that we actually have the technology to make it a reality. In my opinion, VR hasnt taken off as much as 
I expected, I think it might be because a better interface hasnt been developed yet and advertising for it hasnt been as
profitable as it should have been.
The second article about Artificial Life is explored by a Romantic love experiment developed by Professor S. Farsad who got a
doctorate in Philosophy and had some writtings about our thinking. She states that it would be easier if artificial life 
could love, it would reproduce much faster especially if it could love romantically. She researches how love works and the 
stages of such in the development phases that it must undergo for it to happen and to prove that it is in fact true. Artificial
life is talked about nowadays in a more serious and even dangerous manner since now it's a close reality with the advancement
of our technological advances.
