  The role of women in the video game industry has always, in my mind, been a very significant issue. 
In the fledgling days of video games, the consumer base mostly consisted of male gamers, especially in online video games such as Quake or Counter Strike. 
In a male dominated field such as this, it made the process of incorporating females into the player base especially difficult on the part of the girls who wanted to play. 
This led to the stigma that girls could not or should not be gamers, and only men should be playing the games, which is utterly ridiculous. 
There have been female gamers since the day video games were created, and are no different from any other player out there. They deserve a place in the gaming world, and a voice within it as well. 


  The website GamerGirlz, is a feminist site dedicated to giving female gamers a voice within the gaming landscape, where they are constantly berated by other demographics. 
The creator, Vangie “Aurora” Beal, claims to have created the site for the concept of equality in the gaming scene, which to some may seem “pro-woman” and “anti-male”. 
This could not be further from the truth, and this is solely because women have not had a chance to voice their opinions to a large audience within this space. 
Women have been objectified in the gaming industry, as some games are guilty of having “fan-service” in their games. 
The worst offender of this I’ve played is a game called Tera, where the men wear full suits of armor, but the women wear the exact same thing, and it is extremely revealing. 
Not all games are like this however, as Dark souls and Skyrim have both the male and female variants of armor look and function exactly the same. 


  Women have been getting an increasing amount of coverage in games these days, both as players, but also as characters. Games such as The Last of Us and Tomb Raider introduce strong, independent female characters who hold as much sway and relevance to the plot, proving how capable they truly are. 
Ellie, from The Last of Us, is one of the best female characters ever written in a game, as her gender, for the most part, plays little relevance into who she is. 
She is not the damsel in distress, needing to be saved constantly, as whenever she is captured in the game, she rescues herself, with her partner, Joel only arriving during the aftermath. 
It is okay to be a feminist when it comes to the gaming industry, as well as technology as a whole, because women deserve a place within it just as much as men do.
