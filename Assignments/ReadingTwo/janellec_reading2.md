<p>The article from SWITCH which I choose was <em>The Influence of Politics of Identity and Merging Digital and Bio-Technologies on Human Representation in Late 20th Century Art</em> by Geri Wittig.
The article talks about the idea of the World Wide Web as a medium, and its effectiveness on media, humans, and culture. As the internet became more accessible and fast, the internet was able to reach a wider, more diverse audience. 
And for the art world, technological advancements led to the start of a digital age. This was not limited to "digital media", but also the affect of technology on our own bodies. 
Artists of the 80s and 90s worked increasingly with the concepts of identity, and what dictates our definitions of identity and what individual's identities comprise of.
 Wittif talks of the "politics of identity", the societal norms and "rules" of gender, race, ethnicity, etc., and how technology can manipulate our perception of these politics.

<p>The concept of cyborgs was birthed from science, and the technical age has guided "cyborgs" into a complex genre of humans which more often than not, we are surrounded by in our every day lives.
 Despite the age of this article, cyborgs remain a relevant and controversial topic in the art world. The definition of a cyborg is often debated, or rather the "politics" of what makes a cyborg.
 The earlier scientists had numerous ideas of what the defining factor is: technology attached to humans, technology aiding/enhancing a person's biological functions, and technology within the human's body.

 These factors have obviously changed with time, as technological advancements provide the means for prosthetics, pacemakers, hearing aids, Google Glass, and the initial birth of a human into an age of enveloping, nearly-omnipresent technology.
 <p>Humans of today are born and raised as operators of technology, or "natural born cyborgs". The concept of marrying science with our perception of identity has elevated to new levels of reality <em>and fantasy</em>.
 The cheesy sci-fi flicks' funky robots and ideas of what are futuristic are now dated, with some famous tropes being either realized as modern technology, or adapted to what our 21st century technology can facilitate and evolve towards.
 The art world is extremely aware and critical of this gradual transformation, and due to the agelessness of the identity of a human/cyborg, will continue to be inspired and influence it. There is so much content and potential in these concepts, and this does not even include the concepts of "artifical life" and telepresence, two other giant, complex entities that conplicates the cyborg/human relationship further.
