Michelle Wright discussed in this article on how we have tried preventing racial discrimination since the colonial/US declaring independence to the modern days;
all men are created equal, fighting to abolish slavery, and so forth.
With the rise of technology, diversity resurfaces some of these negative connotations and tend to attract harm along with positive factors;
this is possible because people had the ability to express thoughts on the internet with low chance of suffering any consequences.
With more recent events, Black Lives Matter movement for example, sparked plenty of controversy and conflicting ideas; technology and connectivity portrayed a majority of African Americans in a negative direction.
I would like to branch off this topic more geared towards expressing opinions without thinking twice.

I think the internet opens up the door to a lot of things in terms of the goods, and the bad; in this case, expressing or sharing ideas and point-of-views.
I personally believe that internet should be unrestricted to all, but it is individual’s responsibility to moderate themselves for their activities.
It is understandable that people just express a lot of things because they believe they have a low risk of getting in trouble, and think the internet itself is its own entity;
but in reality, a lot of people have access to it, and will eventually stumble upon idea the person puts out.
Situations will be complicated when people follow negative ideology that will harm others, and have the government try to intervene, and the downward spiral gets deeper.
In essence, it is individuals or the collectives’ responsibility on the content they put out.
