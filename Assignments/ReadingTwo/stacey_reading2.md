In the Switch article, "Time types and Table Manners" the author, Marc BÃ¶hlen talks about an interactive table called "DinnerTable"
to represent interactive art and how it relates to social media. The table is an interactive piece that features a game that mimics
a game of life with different scenarios, a cast of characters and in a aninymous urban setting. The piece is meant to act like a 
table, but it functions like a machine and a game. In addition, the table visual and audio inputs are used to direct the narrative paths
and spin off narrative tracks in the form of a board game. The idea requires two people in a dining environment, who sit across from
each other with the DinnerTable in between. Between quests the DinnerTable will act as a commentator on events or stories while 
actively employs multiple notions of time to distinguish typologies. DinnerTable sorts the data by the time categories: oscillatory,
machinic and perceptual. Oscillatory time is known as discrete time, or time form of scientific abstraction and formalization.
Machinic time is time derived from oscillaroty but expands on concrete applications. Perceptual time functions as the possibilities and
limitation. With these components the DinnerTable collects audio and visual data from the interactions and then situates itself between
the users. In comparison to social media, the DinnerTable is sort of a method that parallels anxiety that many people go through on a daily bases
The piece creates different forms of social exchanges as the machine records the stuff you do on the quests. This called knowledge-based
intimacy which may help anxiety in the future. 

Honestly, the idea of machines recording a persons actions isn't anything new. It's been done a lot, but what really stood out was the
way the machine tries to make someone trying to socialize on social medias. Since a lot of people use these on a daily bases it's
interesting to see how all of the stuff online may cause social anxiety. The concept is very simple, but the way it sorts actions
for quests through time, makes the piece unique. I've seen anxiety all the time online, and how it can impact the users. I would
say that this machine can easily reflect that feeling, but at the same time it tries to be supportive and help the user through the
journey in the game. However, I wonder why the machine is in a dining environment instead of other areas. It could be because of the
aesthetics of the machine, but I feel like this could be placed in other environments and still function the same way. However, I can 
understand the reasoning, mostly because I feel like dining out in public gets people nervous. The piece is interesting and I would
like to see and try it in person. At the same time I believe that a machine like this could impact the future if it is given a chance.
