In The Body, Post Humans and Cyborgs: The Influence of Politics of Identity and Emerging Digital and Bio-Technologies on Human Representation in Late 20th Century Art, Wittig discussed the change in human communication as the internet evolve. This subject has been heavily debated and I do think that social media has a negative impact on communication skills. One of these skills is manners. Simply things like avoiding to say hi when walking past someone you know becomes clingy. But then of course everyone is different. As technology advances I feel like less and less people are educating themselves about machine language. Coding a website, for example, not that many people know how to do.
