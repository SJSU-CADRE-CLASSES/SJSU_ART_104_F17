      To begin with, the first article that grabbed my attention was &quot;Dancing on the
Web, Dancing over the Ocean&quot; by Nora Raggio. It has generally been taken place in
California as a live multi cultural exhibition by mainly by young individuals often
times in tech museums. And those performances are then webcast. In addition, the
main objective of the project is to encourage the intersection between cultures and
between the arts as well as technology. To me, I found this article really interesting
to explore and learn more about it.
      An interview has been done with Nora Raggio herself to ask her more about
her principal interest and objectives regarding this project. Norra then stated that
her background has always been in media production as an independent producer
and she was launching WIRED magazine back in 1993. Moreover, Norra loved to
create all sorts of live events on the web and live experiences that incorporated
technology throughout the Bay Area and actually around the world and continued to
become excited and involved about combining different types of media and
experiences which led her to the cable industry. Thus, she worked very hard
launching two cable networks that were both going to be leveraging the
convergence of cable and the web and programming as well as their outreach to
their overall community and audience base through the internet.
      Furthermore, GroundZero was one of her best project that she was in.
GroundZero has three main mandates as an organization. One of them is to incubate
art projects and facilitate artists that are working in the space of the intersection of
art and technology. The second mandate is to build and foster our community so
that we are creating opportunities for them to have a new form of arts, participate,
as well help in some way, shape, or form. The third is to continually foster
opportunities and education space for kids with art and technology. So the first
project in the education space is Dancing On the Web, Dancing Over the Ocean:
Young Partners in Senegal and Silicon Valley. Eventually, she mentions that what
they were doing is creating a performance opportunity for a group of youth in
Silicon Valley to co-collaborate with a group of youth in Senegal, to actually have a
live, multicultural, dance performance.
      To me, that was something great as Silicon Valley is the heart of technology
and a perfect place with high possibilities for Nora Raggio to start with such big
project.
