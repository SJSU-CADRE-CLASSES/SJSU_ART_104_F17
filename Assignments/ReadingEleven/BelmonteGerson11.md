Digital Images loose quality by a number of reasons, people dont usually notice. It can happen through processes like download, copies, edited, shared, etc. As Steyerl states, high quality images are always desired, putting them at the top of hill, while all other images stay at the bottom left unwanted. Thus, gives an example in how our society works, in whatever it is really. Good looking, rich and sharp to the eye people, things, or experiences will always be put first. 

What Steyerl is trying to convey here reminds me of something John Berger said on his series "Ways of Seeing" as it pertain to paintings, a more physical type of image, and its quality value: "Images have become mysterious again, not because of the representation or medium used, not even because of the beauty of the work, but because of its market value, and that value comes from the it being genuine or not". Images, whether they are digital or physically created, loose value and quality as it is reproduced over and over again. 

Steyerl concludes that poor quality images are like films of the past that essentially point towards the future. An example of this can be the notion that poor images show history, as opposed to high resolution ones, which are usually used as commercial. 
This allows me to appreciate the advances in our technology and in the high resolution of images we have at our disposal nowadays.
