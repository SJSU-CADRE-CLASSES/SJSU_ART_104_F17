Hito Steyerl's paper on digital picture and video is very defensive. She just admits that our digital image is not good because of compression and other technical problem.  In reality, image quality is improved so much that we don't need darkroom at all.  Film editing still have issues with the software where UI stinks. It is not because video resolution where we can easily process 4K. During the early days of the Internet, 180p video because the most standard hard disk is small and internet are small. Videos are much easier to handle nowadays. So there should not be any problem.
Production of a video is hard until recently. There is always compromise during video production. Last semester, we can edit a 4k video in Adobe Premiere. So, this is why movies are becoming clearer and brighter because of advance in camera quality. 
Digital web design is much more accessible as Processing.js allows a non-technical artist to produce fantastic web series. 

The history of video distribution is very interesting. The first way of the recording film is on 35mm tape. It was very bothersome, but it has a very clear image when it is new. The machine is very big and hard to use; it needs lots of maintained. Betamax was first home video system; it was clumsy and expensive. VHS is a refinement of Betamax, and it was popular from the 80s to late 2000s.  There is some flaw like for example; the picture quality is substandard. Most people love DVD because it is first time video is considered a data and the video output is very high quality. Genuine DVDs are very popular in America. VCD was common in Asia because it is cheaper than DVD, but both produce a disc that is digital. Blu-ray is a transition from physical media to digital content download from the internet.
