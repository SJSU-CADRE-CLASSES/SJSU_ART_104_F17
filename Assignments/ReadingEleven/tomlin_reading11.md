Hito Steyerl debates that low quality images are reflection of the reality because of its nature: blurred, low resolution, in motion, out-of-focus, and so forth. Even though these exist and represent reality, the low quality images are not used in commercialized field because of all the flaws. Steyerl’s article coincides with John Berger’s Way of Seeing things because society as a whole is forced to forego the vision of imperfection, and only focus on the good. But yet the imperfections exist. I think this is a very relevant topic because people curate their best work, but do not know how much goes into the work.

In my early days of photography practice, I would shoot a handful of, and retouch them thinking most of them are good. But over time, I shoot multiple shots of one location or angle, pick one out of the bunch, and edit them; In the sense of learning, it makes sense to show all your work. But for getting commission work, you’d have to put your best foot forward. In relations to the article, my previous work, regardless of quality and quantity, exists in my archive; they are a representation of the foundation I have built in the particular practice, and improve myself. Also, my photography practice and the article can be a direct analogy to an iceberg; you could only see the tip, but not the rest of it.
