Poor Image Response

The author of this article, Ms. Steyerl, first speaks about what makes a poor image a poor image. The resolution is one of the main factors, as well as how it is shared between many people instead of being held behind a pay-wall for only the people who have the money to see it. The poor image can be circulated much easier than a perfected, sharp image can be, and that gives the poor image a greater shareability. This gives the image more viewability, and grants it a greater social merit between those doing the sharing than something that may have to be paid for in order to view and enjoy. 

This shareability can still affect the "rich" image. The ability to share a poor image to a much greater audience means that even a poor image of a rich image can be shared more easily than the rich image by itself. I think that the poor image of the rich image can still give the rich image a wider audience and greater social standing. The poor image in a way helps distribute the rich image. The poor image may never be as sharp and seductive as the rich image, but the main idea of the work, even though less sharp, is still shared.

For instance, take the way cinema is recorded now. Even though physical film is greater resolution, we opt for the digital that may leave artifacts that the original film would not. These digital images are easier to distribute, because you do not need a machine that can read and display physical film, you only need a computer or digital device that can play video, which many have in their hands every day like a smart phone or a computer. This new cinema of digital film makes it easier to make many copies and not lose resolution. The new digital media is a large contributor to the non-existence of the poor image, with cameras and images being able to capture greater resolutions and distribute them much easier.
