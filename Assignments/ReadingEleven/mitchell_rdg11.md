## ART 104 - Reading 11

The photograph and the video capture scenes, moments, and movements. They can be presented in the camera itself or as physical prints, or be projected on screens and digital devices. The original can be used as is, or it can be edited and manipulated with. When doing the latter, however, the information it carries changes and is no longer the same as the original. This 'new' image may lose information, quality, and resolution, but the author argues that this 'poor' image is now something completely different and independent from its precedent. It itself has become a new work of art, because it is now _not_ what it had been originally—"it is about its own real conditions of existence. [...] It is about defiance and appropriation just as it is about conformism and exploitation".

The digital world today, thanks to the Internet and emerging technologies, is full of edited and manipulated images. Every page we visit—every element we see on those webpages—has gained its own individual existence as it is no longer in its original appearance or form. In her essay, Steyerl points out that, albeit information may be lost or changed, 'poor' images are able to show a new side to the original image. In fact, some low-res images may hold more contextual information and a larger story to tell than its high-res counterpart.

With privatization and capitalism, higher resolution images—or the 'rich' images—have been attached prices for it to be publicly available. Consumers will still purchase such content because of its high qualities, regardless of their price tags. On the other hand, this privatization enables for the 'poor' images to circulate into the community where they are made available, but may be pirated or appropriated. The 'poor' images may still hold enough information as the original content, if not, more.

As the author kept describing the qualities and features of 'poor' images, I was constantly reminded of images known as 'leaks' prior to a release of new products. In the case of iPhones, months prior to its official releases or announcements, supposedly leaked photographs start to emerge from anonymous or unknown leakers or from production factories that reveal glimpses or prototypes of the new product. These images are usually of low quality and blurred, alluding to the fact that they are hoaxes and are fabricated to make them look like they are real. However, some photos turn out to be actual leaks, but they look no different than from the 'fake leaks'. The same phenomena can be seen prior to the release of video games, like Pokémon, where fans speculate on the authenticity of 'leaked' content from the newest games.
