		Searching the term “Lamprey”, in any search engine is sure to produce some of the 
	creepiest images on the internet. These blood sucking parasitic fish are known to 
	latch onto their prey, bleeding them dry until they move on to the next host. 
	The images shown in the search results is meant to introduce the viewer to 
	what a Lamprey looks, does, and acts. It is meant to serve as an introduce through
	the means of “You want a Lamprey? Alright, here is a Lamprey.” 
	This is a process discovered by Walter Benjamin known as the “optical unconscious”. 
	This term is used to describe the effect of revealing the “unseen” to the viewer 
	within their own reality, revealing to them something they would not normally see. 
	According to the article, the “unseen” in the Lamprey’s case is something
	we do not see in our normal everyday life, which would be the mouths and teeth of these creatures. 

		I find this philosophy to be enlightening, as it allows us to view the world
	in many different ways aside from what we are used to in everyday life. 
	No person goes through their day looking at Lamprey’s the entire time, 
	unless one is specifically studying Lampreys. This sentiment reveals 
	the true power of photography, as it allows us, the viewer, to gaze into a 
	world we cannot simply experience with our own eyes, to view the “unseen”. 
	This is the allure of art, to allow the viewer to experience something new, 
	and in creative, imaginative ways. The idea of using Processing to create code-based art, 
	centered around using the data collected by the images of the Lamprey’s themselves 
	was an ingenious move by the artist. It allows the user to not only experience the Lamprey 
	in a 3D environment, thanks to the data being extruded by the program itself. 
	It also allows the viewer to see the creature be transferred into the digital realm 
	without even knowing the process is happening. While in progress shots are included, 
	the viewer would not be able to tell it was a Lamprey unless it was told to them directly.
 
		I have always enjoyed the genre of art which has transformed something unsightly, 
	or otherwise unremarkable, into a thing of beauty. 
	Lamprey’s are clearly terrifying creatures, but through the use of programming and art, 
	we are able to view them in a new, and wondrous way.
