  The article pointed out quite a bit of misrepresentation shown on google but I’m just going to point out a few points. In simple terms, google images made these parasitic fishy look really deadly and scary. The first section of the images showed mostly teeth, more teeth, and bite marks. Well that is really on the negative side. I hardly even knew these fishy even had eyes or a fish like body. The teeth as Yvette said is evident. This does show what is scary about them but the lamprey has more to them. So, I’m guessing this is why Yvette wanted to add in the animated swimming movements through Processing to add more than just scary teeth. This has a similar case with sharks being dangerous in the media. The media shined a negative light on sharks as being “killers” or “dangerous”. While shark attacks are like extremely low each year. They just look threatening similar to the lamprey. Though I could be wrong about Yvette’s intentions about writing this article though. It was confusing to read for me. <p> </p>

This 2nd paragraph is going to be about Yvette’s other intention for writing this. I believe that Yvette is trying to say that photography doesn’t capture the essence of the lamprey but what the photographer wants the people to see. As on google images, the teeth are more highlighted. So photography isn’t showing the truth of the animal but a false perception of it. Photo-fiction on the other hand will show us the true lamprey with false imagery. The Processing program will show us how the lamprey swim or live. I believe that is what she is saying at least. It’s like looking at a Instagram photo of a friend all happy and cheerful but you don’t know what is truly going on behind that photo of that person. You have to talk to the person if they are actually happy in that photo. <p> </p>

I’m pretty sure my first point isn’t what Yvette was thinking but I find it interesting. </body>
