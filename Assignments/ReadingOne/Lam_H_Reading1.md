**PROCESSING/LAMPREYS —PHOTO-FICTION AS DIGITAL PARASITE AESTHETICS**
  
  
    In the article "PROCESSING/LAMPREYS —PHOTO-FICTION AS DIGITAL PARASITE AESTHETICS" by Yvette Granata. She talks about the use of goggle search engine, anmd how it is used when representing data to us.
  When we search images on google, the server gives us images based on what people commonly want to see, in this situation when lampreys are searched,
  the data that in sent to us shows us that Lampreys are a type of worm parasite. This is represented by the multiple images of the Lampreys teeth and eel like bodies.
  Howver, Granata wants us to know that these images do not entirely represent the Lamprey in real life entirely. For all we know they may look scary but could be gentle creatures.
  She then talks about Walter Benjamin's optical unconcious, how the images represent unseen or rarely captured representations of the lampreys.
    Benajamin says It is through the camera that we first discover the optical unconscious’ (Benjamin, ‘Little History’, 512). Through the photograph, and through the image search engine, the objects that we have never seen are shown to us.
  The camera captures images that we would have a hard time seeing in real time, sometimes giving a different perspective to the real thing.
  In the google image, the images represent a animal with a eel like body withj fangs, iot does not give us the information like what does it eat, how does it move,
  how does it sound. These things can only be experienced in person. 
  It is also mention that Rolands Barthes myth takes place when looking at google images. His myth states that something is always 'added to' the sign,
  the photo of the Lampreys center focuses on its teeth and gives it a new representation of the animal as a whole. When people think of Lampreys after
  looking at the photo, they will associate one of the main factors of the Lamprey as having many teeth. However, the images only show you what it wants to,
  for all we know the Lampreys rarely show their teeth and are non threathning in person. 
    In conclusion, the author wants us to understand that when looking at google images or other images that show us something, we cannot and should not make a full representation of it,
    until we try to see it from multiple angles. We cannot understand how somrthing is by consuming information from one perspective, a perspective that was
    hand picked or have other intentions. In this case the intention was to show the Lampreys deadly teeth. Also, photography can sometimes misrepresent real life
    it can capture moments that are rarely seen in real life, therefore it gives us an misrespresentation and expectation to the real thing.
