In the article, “Processing/Lampreys: Photo-Fiction as Digital Parasite Aesthetics” by Yvette Granata, the author discusses the difference 
between a real lamprey and a photo of one. In the article, Granata argues that when we see a photo of a lamprey we instantly categorize 
the animal in a negative context given its appearance of sharp teeth and it’s blood sucking qualities. However, we don;t come into 
consideration as what and why exactly it does. We don’t take into context that the lamprey sucks blood in order for it to survive. Granata 
talks about photo fiction about discussing how the photos of lampreys posted on the google search does not tell us quite enough 
information on the creature besides appearance. It plays in our minds on what we only expect from the image. We perceive what we see and 
react to what is on the image appropriately. In this case, the real lamprey is null and void for us and what we presume in the photo is 
the correct one.

Granata then moves onto Processing, Javascript, and After Effects and creates a series of animations that focuses on the movement and 
structure of a lamprey. She creates these animations, as she describes, as a way for “photo-fiction to be seen as a different realism of 
photography.” For what I can tell, she wishes to use these images as a way to change the perception of the lamprey by her description. 
Basically, it is what the artist does that creates the perceived meaning. Because Granata uses coding than simply taking a photo, the 
product of her work also perceives a different idea with it’s approach to create the lamprey.

I believe that Granata creates a relationship between the internal and external thought processes. With her work, the lamprey is almost 
indistinguishable from the real creature. In all honestly, the photos of the lamprey would seen to portray it more accurately. However, 
both are lampreys. Granata focuses the image on the lamprey’s parasitic nature and thus, both the photo and the works are both equal 
representations. I believe what she does here connects well to the idea of photo-fiction and the realism of photos than we as the viewers 
see. I found this article interesting with how it points out the different approaches we see in art and the line between realism and 
fiction; what we know is true and what we perceive as true.
