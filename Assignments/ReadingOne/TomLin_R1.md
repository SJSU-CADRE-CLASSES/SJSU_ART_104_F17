The article, From ‘Photo of Lamprey’ to ‘Photo-Fictional Lamprey’, discusses about Lamprey as parasitical organisms, how they are portrayed, and artists applying the parasitic elements into the creative arts. I think the author’s stance is interesting because he states that people see Lamprey’s as, based on imagery, as fanged-organisms, and how us humans have these parasitical elements in creativity. The Lamprey analogy was that they stick onto the host, and leech blood off; it’s their source of food. The author related this concept by taking the parasitical elements into generative art; he utilized JavaScript, Processing, and after effects, and made his own parasitical art. 

In my own practice, I will conduct research on various people’s style or look into natural/manmade scenes, implement them into my own practice; for example, I took this picture (left) of the magnifying lenses at Marina Bay’s Cloud Forest, and implement the elements into my vector art (right). Especially in the creative field, people absorb elements from one another to have various kind of advantages. Eventually as humans, we would have to adapt to our surroundings in order to further push ourselves, including in the art field.
