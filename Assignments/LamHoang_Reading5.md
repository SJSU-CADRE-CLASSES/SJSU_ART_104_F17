Identify Yourself by Kyrstal South

After reading "Identifying yourself", I understand that Krystal is expressing her opinion on the future of society and our culture with the 
continued use of the internet and technology. She says that after this generation no one would know what it was like to live in a world 
without the internet. Therefore, they will grow up fundamentally different and perceive the world differently as we did. She expresses her 
need to have computers and the internet to function with society, it has shaped her external and internal self. before the internet,  
sharing information was slow and lackluster. We would need to travel or wait for data to be consumed, in the form of physical paper like books or sharing data in person.
With the invention of the internet we now have what South calls the "quick addiction", which is the ability to consume data at an increase rate that
has allowed for our creativity and accomplishments to thrive. The ability to access data on the go and have information at the touch of a
button has allowed us to do things we were never able to before. With the invention of the wireless internet it has extended our knowledge from 
home base computers to always have this infinite database in the space of our pocket. 

South says that this access to quick and fast data has made us impatient as humans, and I agree. Before when the internet was first introduced, I could wait minutes or days to have my information,
however, now if a page does not load in the first 5 seconds I try and find a new source and assume the page is corrupted, or just become uninterested
entirely. With the downtime of load and waiting it becomes a feeling of wasted moments that we could be use doing other things. The internet has then
changed our way of thinking and how we want to consume data.

I believe as time goes on and the data speed increases, so will our though process, maybe eventually our species will evolve with the internet to consume
data even more rapidly or one day be plugged into the internet phsyically. With the rapid changed to how we feel and are interconnected with the
data, it would not be entirely impossible to plug our brains one day into the web.

She summarizes that  we must help and keep the internet safe and open to everyone. So in the future people can use it as freely as we have it now.
She is inspired by the evolving technology like her phone, laptop, and the software contained in them. She has the feeling of empowerment to learn, create and communicate.
