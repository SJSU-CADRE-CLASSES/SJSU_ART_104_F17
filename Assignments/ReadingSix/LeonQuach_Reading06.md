In Towards a Poetics of Artificial Superintelligence, by Nora N. Khan introduces a futuristic visual interpretation of AI and machines with the use of imagination and metaphors. Nora continues to explain our capacity for imagination bringing up aliens on how they are perceived in creation by humans. Then shows us works written about AI, showing us the term of ASI(artificial superintelligence).  A philosopher Nick Bostrom, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, Nora explains the details of Bostrom’s metaphors on ASI ranging to a future to avoid and a future where ASI is sustainable with humanity. I found this reading to be imaginative and reorienting.

What I found to be imaginative was the understanding and poetic articulation in ASI. Nora brings up a question by cyberneticist Kevin Warwick “How can you reason, how can you bargain, how can you understand how [a] machine is thinking when it’s thinking in dimensions you can’t conceive of?” A question which nora brings up a statement mentioned by Jackie Wong with the topic of aliens to answer. 

“I left feeling that representations of aliens are an index of the human imagination — they represent our desire for new forms. But what has always confused me about depictions of aliens in movies and books ... Is it true that all we can do when imagining a new form of life is take the human form, fuck with the proportions, enlarge the head, remove the genitals, slenderise the body, and subtract a finger on each hand?… We strain to imagine foreignness, but we don’t get very far from what we know.”

Wong’s further states her own alien with the use of imagination. The thoughts of having based off the wonders of ASI on what a human can do if they had this or that to an extreme level. 

With the statement of the imaginative possibilities, Nora provides us with AI fictions. The fictions have developed many scenarios of AI capabilities. Mentioning of that AI is doomsday rhetoric in the majority of dialogue. Instead of the usual AI is going to end humankind, Nora introduces a more specific view on ASI: Nick Bostrom and his metaphors. Bostrom proposes the ideas of ASI being a hurricane, frontline, scaffolding, sovereign, and much more. Bostrom points out a “bitter determination to be as competent as we can, much as if we were preparing for a difficult exam that will either realise our dreams or obliterate them.” Nora ends with that humans are responsible of AI and have to prepare and calculate for the worse.
