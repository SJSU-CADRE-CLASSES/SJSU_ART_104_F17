Artificial Superintelligence is just a study of a computer involving countries. At first, Nora N. Khan talks about the alien. The alien is the AI that understands our language, our culture, and our belief.  She thinks that AI is a hurricane because the way of AI has changed very fast. ASI is very big and affects the industry. While ASI has changed the industry, ASI is still in a humble beginning. ASI may not have empathy but can be trained with machine training. On the other hand, AI is built by humans that are designed by engineers who are following the specs. They cannot care that there is no human touch unless they are asked to include in the specs. 
 It is maybe foreign for senior people to be helped by the robot. There is a hurricane of societal changes due to new technology. The camera can spy on grandma or grandpa. You have the robot that can clean up the mess or dispense medicine. The nurse will be coming to the residence less often as a bot controls primary thing.  Changes are happening soon because there are lots of baby-boomer needs help and there are not enough young people to work in the gruesome job.
 Predicting the future is very hard. UPS are using AI to save money and resources. UPS drivers can drop, and pick up packages are efficiently utilizing an algorithm that they pioneered. Saving energy and labor costs are primarily motive. Pharmacy chain can easily stock most essential medicines across their stores. Amazon warehouses are not typical. Robots pick up items from the shelves after the stockers are told by computers to put things in seemingly random locations.
