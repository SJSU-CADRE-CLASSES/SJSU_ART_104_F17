The reading depicts the deepest fear of the ASI, which is the final form of the AI we familiar with. When I read this article, I feel like kind of scared yet excited about the ASI. As the reading mentioned, the ASI is almost like a god, a god that based on or probably beyond human being’s understanding, wisdom---omnipotent, omniscient. 
 
The feeling of scary comes from the mighty the ASI would have, “Our intelligence, in relation to ASI, as analogous to what the intelligence of an ant feels like to us.” and the humanity cannot be applied on this powerful “life”. Because neither malign nor benevolent the ASI will be. She might have a completely logical and rational behavior system to evaluate things; a rigid standard to judge if it is “1” or “0”. Based on the natural of dualism that a machine supposed to have, just like the ASI “VIKI” in the movie “I, Robot”. What’s more, the VIKI ASI in the movie is designed as a benevolent one, she wanted to control human beings in the sake of protecting them, in a extremely rational way, just like how human protect the animals in danger--we breed them in captivity. The benevolent ASI could came up with this idea, let along the ASI that is neither malign nor benevolent, or even a malign one.
 
It is always our natural to fear something that is strong, or something that we don’t understand. But the ASI is still too far away from nowadays. Though they are supposed to be super strong or godlike strong, we are still in the process. The technology cannot blast in such short period. So maybe we can limit the ASI with more specific laws like the Three Laws in the movie, to make them service us well and have less risks. After all, the developing of the technology is always a inspiring thing to me. We shouldn’t stop our pace because of this fear.
