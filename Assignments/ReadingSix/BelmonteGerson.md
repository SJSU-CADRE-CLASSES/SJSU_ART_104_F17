Artificial Intelligence is the next big thing for humankind. As of now it is in the beginning stages, 
but at the rate that technology advances nowadays, it is only a matter of time, and as the article 
states: “It’s not about whether it is coming, but about when”. It is very interesting that our creativity 
is boxed in when we try to visualize or display advancement for the future. We can have a conception of 
what AGI will be once it is fully developed, but we fail to see the world when ASI arrives. 

ASI will surpass the brightest minds and the most advanced hard drives and it’ll be up to it to choose 
in which direction the world will be steered towards. It’ll have a reasoning different than the right or wrong we have,
thus giving it the possibility of anything and everything. As much as we would imagine ASI like us, 
its communication, processes, behavior, language, travel etc. could be unlike anything we have ever seen or imagined
could exist. 

I wonder what made Khan explain the possible aspects of ASI, with the concepts she chose to in the article. 
I think it’s great and relatable to use easy-to-understand notions to explain the bizarre form that AI can take. 
Take an agent for example, they have no attachments, they get work done, secures its present and future, etc. 
AI can, like this agent, generate pure action with perfect result, able to manipulate resources, people and nature
for self-survival is not a moral problem. It is very fascinating to me that maybe our poetic language towards
it can change and improve, but whatever ASI will do in the future won’t be diminished or altered unless we stop 
technological advances and curiosity, but as humans, that’s not really an option.
