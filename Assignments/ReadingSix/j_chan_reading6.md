<p>The writer makes a point that ASI would only be realized after an artificial general intelligence or an AI that truly holds the essence of being "human",
is realised. It is interesting that the mass perception of AI is alien, or so far removed from humans, and yet it is only through achieving a "human" AI that
 ASI can be created. ASI, in a way, is an embodiment of the human concious, but "perfected".

And yet, this "perfect" AI, that captures the image and likeness of man is equally the most terrifying future possible as it is wonderous.
 For with each step that research and development towards a more advanced AI that humans take, the line between human and the digital blurs.
 Eventually, it may be possible for it to be impossible to discern the difference, or for robots to replace humans entirely. Robots already
 act as substitutes for more dangerous labour, but there is no telling when they will begin being utilized for more. There are two questions that
 advancements in robotics and AI raise to society: will humans eventually be replacable, and will AI eventually deem humans unnecessary?</p>
 <p>
 Of course, these questions are just speculation from a cynical onlooker, but it is important to keep these questions in mind as the digital age
 continues to intertwine with our everyday lives. In a world where identity and individuality are key to what determines what is a "person",
 the continued blurring of this definition and image is deadly.
