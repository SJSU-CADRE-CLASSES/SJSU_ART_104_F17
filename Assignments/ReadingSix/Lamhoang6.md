Khan wants us to imagine a world with a super intelligent AI that has almost god like powers, to see the future and past with unlimited data resources. This computer AI is able to process data we can't even comprehend, maybe thinking in another dimension from our understanding. If this AI were to exist it could destryo us or save us. If hooked to the internet what kind of damage could it do, can we imagine a rogue AI inside the internet. A super ASI AI, that has surpassed any human knowledge or anything we are capable of. Khans words are a scary thought to think about. Something simliar mentioned by Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, is that we must tread lightly when creating AI as it could be the end of humanity. Other scientist have expressed concerns about the creation of AI, like Stephen Hawkins.
We can take some notes from movies like IRobot and Terminator, where AI's have turned on humans in order to save the planet from humans, seeing humans as the ultimate threat to ourselves and to the earth. 
ASI is a tier above AI and AGI, ASI are able to think and learn and reason like humans. Therefore they could ultimatly break there own laws or set programs given from their creators. ASI could function in ways we cant even comprehend.

Cyberneticist Kevin Warwick asks, ‘How can you reason, how can you bargain, how can you understand how [a] machine is thinking when it’s thinking in dimensions you can’t conceive of?’
Khan describes AI as almost being alien like, as we might be able to create aliens ourselves before being visited. 
Khans overall message is that AI's or ASI are terrifying and could posses an unimaginable amount of power if not checked properly. We could eventually end humanity with the creation of AI's
