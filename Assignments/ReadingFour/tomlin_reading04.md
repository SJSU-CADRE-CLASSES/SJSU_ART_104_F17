Molly Wright discusses about Artificial Intelligence in the context of architecture and design. Wright stated that Designers play an important role because they can analyze the AI’s structures, and aid in the design process. Wright also discusses about design thinking for AI because they understand how to approach the factors of what people want. In addition, Wright discussed about the human-machine symbiotic relationship because we already relying on computers to complete specific tasks. I agree with what Wright discussed on Artificial Intelligence because AI are keeping us engaged with the media we are using.
My example would be browsing on Amazon and Facebook because every time I log on, either of these platforms would bombard me with the items I have browsed, or something similar. It is obvious that both Amazon and Facebook have an algorithm (in this case, Artificial Intelligence) that caters to the person’s interest, and sometimes it is like an in-your-face thing. In reality, I believe that this whole user or audience in mind is being taken advantage of. In relation to our class’s theme of Blockchain Technology or DAPPS (Decentralized Applications), AI are dependent on database; thus making them more powerful.
Blockchain’s nature of near-infinite copy of data will empower AI to access all of the data, and quite potentially distribute backup version amongst them. It does sound very science-fiction, but we are reaching that point because we are pushing technology at exponential growth rate.
