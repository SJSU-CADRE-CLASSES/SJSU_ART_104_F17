Artificial Intelligence can be implemented into almost anything with some tech around us. Molly Wright starts off by relating the concept to architecture and describes it as an intelligence very common nowadays since it is used with many aspects of our lives. Cybernetics is the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things. People claim Artificial Intelligence to be taking over our lives, instead of being viewed as enhancing our lives by facilitating some parts from it.

One of the ways AI is enhancing lives, in this case for architecture, is by how it can create design problem solutions by using a pattern language, which offers solutions without repeating the same. This requires interaction between both machine and human, but there is a future, when the human might not be needed anymore for this since AI would have been so advanced by then, especially if advancements in robotics take place. 

Some of the examples to talk about are mentioned by the work of Cedric Price. He suggests new ways of thinking of the roles of architect, and how consumers’ roles change the significance of architecture. Nicholas Negroponte, another architect that Stenson presents in her arrangement, is the creator of MIT’s Media Lab. His work includes that in theory and practice along with the interaction of AI to work in a collective way with architecture. 

I found it interesting how many people usually think that AI is really new, only to find that through this video AI has been around for a while among us, we just didn’t take note of it. The level of what AI can do has just reached a level in which it can immensely affect our lives, and so we notice. Prior to this AI was more of a concept and had only the first building blocks. I do believe AI to advance rapidly in the next couple of years and do much more than invent a language to communicate on its own, and I hope it’s a good advancement.
