At Eyeo 2017, an art and technology festival held in Minneapolis, Minnesota, designer Molly Wright Steenson spoke about the relationship between architecture and artificial intelligence. 
She begins the seminar with a simple question: “what does artificial intelligence have to do with architecture?” 
Steenson calls upon the works of 3 architects to answer this question: Christopher Alexander, Cedric Prince, and Nicholas Negroponte. Steenson then goes on to posit the fact of cybernetics being the first true use of artificial intelligence, proving the notion of AI being nothing incredibly new to the world. 
Steenson also provides a quote by Marvin Minsky, stating: “I believe…that we are on the threshold of an era that will be strongly influenced, and quite possibly dominated, by intelligent problem-solving machines.” 
This was used as a means of mocking Elon Musk, who said almost the exact same phrase about modern AI over 55 years later. 
The most interesting part of the video came from the section devoted to Cedric Price and how he used artificial intelligence to design buildings, which would then redesign themselves to please those who visited it. 
The project was called the Fun Palace, which was built from 1963-1970.  
The point of the project was to create a symbiosis between the building itself and its visitors, providing additional content to them before they even knew what they wanted. 
The fact this type of technology existed more than 40 years ago is astounding to me, and makes me wonder why this has not yet been implemented in the design process of today’s buildings. 
This type of design philosophy would help overcome several pitfalls commonly attributed with building design. 
The quote by Gordon Pask she shares emulates this perfectly: “Let us turn the design paradigm in upon itself; let us apply it to the interaction between the designer and the system he designs, rather than the interaction between the system and the people who inhabit it.” 
This video changed my perception of what AI is capable of when placed in the right hands. 
The only scope I had for artificial intelligence is of those which were created for video games, something for the player to fight with and against. 
Now I realize the power AI has over the world around us, and how it could benefit our society.
