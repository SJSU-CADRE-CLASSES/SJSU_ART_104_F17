Course Description
------------------
This semesters Interdisciplinary Seminar in Digital Media will work toward bringing SWITCH back online. Through a combination of lectures, presentations, and research, this class will explore old SWITCH articles and rebuild the web platform for a new distribution of SWITCH journal.  The core premise of the class will address individual and collaborative writing exercises, seeking to critically understand cultural normative assumptions about modernity and the use of technology while considering multiple alternatives to the current technological status quo. These assignments will build into the first issue of the re-launch of SWITCH.

Learning Outcomes
-----------------

###### LO1: understand the context of digital media art within contemporary art and society
###### LO2: develop skills in creative research and problem-solving, brainstorming, and visual communication 
###### LO3: deploy their skills for artistic achievement
###### LO4: demonstrate familiarity with the language of visual critique
###### LO5: expand their skills in writing to include analysis, and critical review

Classroom Protocol
==================

Participation
-------------

•	Participation in class discussions for readings, material that we watch in class, giving feedback to your peers on their work is mandatory. Remember that 20% of your grade is based on your participation in class + topic presentation and you are expected to actively participate in such discourses as they are some of the most important sections of our class.
•	On Presentation days you must be able to explain and give a clear presentation of the topic, research, and concepts. If you have a hard time talking in front of a crowd or remembering your points, use a notebook, powerpoint, sketches or bullet points for your presentations. 
•	For readings that I will be assigning in this course you are required to post your reading response (500 word two pages double spaced) response to our class blog. You are asked to think critically and post something that questions, criticizes, endorses, and/or adds to the reading. See the course outline chart for deadlines for these responses.

Grading Policy
--------------

**Seminar Participation = 10% + 10%** 

It is required that you attend and participate regularly in seminar discussion, this will account for 10% of your grade. The course includes engaged group dialogue and student-lead presentations of the assigned readings along with visual material. The student-lead presentations will be assigned at the beginning of the semester and your presentation and preparedness will account for an additional 10% of your grade. Students will be assessed based upon their individual level of engagement in seminar and the quality of student-lead presentations as defined in the grading policy/ rubric below. 

**Weekly Reading Responses = 60% (12 x 5% each response)** 

Required weekly reading and writing assignments must be submitted on the day they are due. Students will submit a double-spaced typed written response per reading assignment (see course schedule for details). Reading responses will illustrate your brief summary of, along with your questions and challenges to, the text. Please use paragraph format, and spell-check - no bullet points. Reading responses will be assessed based upon quality and specificity of your response, as well as attention to key ideas from the assigned readings. 

**Final Paper and Research Presentation = 20%** 

The class will conclude with a 7-page written paper. Final papers and research projects must demonstrate comprehension of, and engagement with, at least two of the primary seminar themes and topics. Research leading to the final presentation will begin in early November when the final project assignment is given.
