## ART 104 - Reading 2

Eric Matthews, in his article [_Web Fungus - Another primitive life model for digital environments_](https://web.archive.org/web/20030902084045/http://switch.sjsu.edu:80/switch/alife/matthews/webfung.html), discusses a specific type of computer virus that focus on assimilating data and material found on web pages. Like real fungi found in the wilderness, computer fungi's primary function is on assimilation, or the ability to interpret virtual information and "[convert] the material being absorbed into something else other than what it started as"<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>. At the time the article was written (September 2003, according to the Wayback Machine), personal computers were more vulnerable to fungi and other viruses than they are today. At the same time, viruses also have grown in strength and in numbers. For example, recently, the worm virus of WannaCry ransomware in May of 2017 posed various threats to computers running on the Windows OS. Although we don't hear much about viruses causing serious problems very often, there isn't any ultimate cure for the virus contamination or the wiping out of all viruses known to man in the Digital Age. Interestingly, the author discusses on the fact that computer fungi can actually be used for beneficial purposes. Users with knowledge on HTML and hypertext tags can utilize fungi to convert static information into "interactive WWW list[s]"<sup>[[1]](#references)</sup>.

A second article, titled [_Artificial Love Life is as Real as the Real Thing_](https://web.archive.org/web/20030902084221/http://switch.sjsu.edu:80/switch/alife/sfarsad/artif_love.html) and written by Professor S. Farsad, talked about a subject that seems relevant even in era we live today and possibly a reality in the near future. Artificial Life, or Artificial Intelligence (AI) nowadays, is a growing innovation that is believed to surpass the intelligence of humans. In this article, Prof. Farsad brings up the question of whether AI will be able to _love_ another being. I believe that AI may figure out algorithms and mathematical functions or patterns that represent the perception of love and other humanly emotions, and thus be able to experience feelings just as we do. It sounds creepy, uneasy, and quite fake, but I believe it will most likely become a reality in a time not too far from now.
