After reading Granta’s Processing/Lampreys. I think that she is showing us that a photograph of a lamprey is actually an imitation. She's discusses the ideas from both Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes. After that she’s explains François Laruelle thoughts on photography. With that she explains how an photograph of an object is merely an imitation. Also involves the use of a programmed software to perceive a lamprey like a human does. I can mostly agree with Granta’s statement, but I am in the middle between disagreeing or agreeing with Laruelle’s ideas. 

Granta’s explains the Roland Barthes myth “in which something is always ‘added to’ the sign, the ‘photo of’ the lamprey is an amplification of lamprey teeth. It produces a mythic threat by centering the lamprey teeth. Through this ‘photograph of’ the lamprey, a reduction of a species also occurs: lamprey = parasite = teeth.” I agree with this I’ve had an experiences with amplifying and a state of reduction with animals I’ve seen on google images. Granta states, “The search results do not show, for example, an array of perspectives of the lamprey in its context, but images of fangs, jaw-less toothed mouths, bites, blood. It is a critique of the parasite, or a definition of the parasite as what it might do to us, a threat-mouth object, a thing that will suck on you.”

She’s explains Francols Laruelles ideas on photography. Beginning to understand Laruelles ideas of  photo-fiction and photographic finitude left me confused. After rereading a bunch of times, I had a loose grasp of his thoughts, Granta states “One of the main tenets of Laruelle’s thought is a critique of philosophy’s separation of thought and immanence. He claims that by thinking about immanence, philosophy has always separated itself from it, calling out philosophy’s auto-position to make claims about immanence or the Real.” My grasp was realizing that there’s a separation of what is in the photograph and what is in the real world of which the photograph was taken, discussed with photo fiction and photographic finitude. 

Granta shows us the processing of a lamprey with code to show that separation. Explaining photo-fiction on effecting the end result. Parasite aesthetics were shown in the finished piece. 

Concluding this response I think that the point Granta make is the differences of what people perceive of reality on google images and photographs then think of that with the real world.
