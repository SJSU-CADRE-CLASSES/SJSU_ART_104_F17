## ART 104 - Reading 4

In her presentation at Eyeo 2017, Molly Wright Steenson talks about the status of A.I. and machine learning. Many say that AI/ML is 'the new black' or 'the new thing', but Steenson says it is not the new _anything_ and is it not technically 'new' at all. Interestingly, AL/ML has been around for quite some time and has been thoroughly developed by the military for various purposes. Steenson brings up in her presentation quotes by several famous technology pioneers, including Elon Musk, Marvin Minsky, and J.C.R. Licklider, who say basically say that humans will need to be prepared for the fact that intelligent machines that humans have created and will create will eventually surpass the intelligence of their creators. I agree with these quotes and also believe that this will be an inevitable fact that computers and robots will reach a point where they realize and recognize their own intelligence, but not to the point where they will start to dominate the human civilization and take over the world, etc.

Steenson continues with this but in a progressive and positive way adding that designers and architects must step in and make their moves in the advancement of AI/ML. AI/ML may be developed by engineers but outside outputs by other facets and disciplines are needed for such an advanced technology to be successful. People like designers and architects should be applying and implementing AI/ML into their works as they can be of great assistance and help push their potential, especially in the Digital Age.

AI/ML is a self-organizing technology and, as its name suggests, _learns_ from previous input from users to predict or make necessary changes to accommodate future inputs. Humans are the smartest species roaming on the planet and I believe are a technology in and of itself. AI/ML will eventually become that—_human_, but much more. Humans have been around for couple hundred millennia, but AI/ML only a couple of decades and is rapidly advancing—much faster than we have evolved and have gotten smarter and smarter. This reality is both frightening, but simultaneously something we must grasp and realize that it is a breakthrough technology that may change how we think of technology itself.
