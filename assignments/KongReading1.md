&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Granata seemed to be saying that a photo of an object is nothing more than an imitation of that object. Similarly, a photo that you get from Google image of a Lamprey is basically an imitation of a Lamprey. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She introduces the definition of photo-fiction by Francois Laruelle. Instead of the photograph of an object, photo-fiction ‘is about rendering the photographic act immanent, of interiorizing it, and rendering it real without an external realism, of destroying philosophical and perceptual sufficiency without denying the necessity for perception’ (Laurelle, Photo-Fiction, 7). Unfortunately, I could not deconstruct the quote she used so I was confused when she started talking about philosophy and its separation from immanence in the next section. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to dictionary.com, imminent means (of mental act) taking place within the mind of the subject and having no effect outside of it. If I’m not wrong, she is basically saying that photo-fiction about taking a photo and showing the object’s true self without external influences like emphasizing certain characteristics of that object. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am also really confused with this next quote by Laruelle: ‘The photographer who ‘captures’ the world—Laruelle posits—is working within a ‘photographic finitude’ in which ‘finitude does not mean the reception of an external given, but an impotency in regard to oneself, a powerlessness to leave oneself so as to go amongst things or—a vision condemned to see according to itself… ‘this stance consists less in situating oneself in relation to the World…than in definitely abstracting oneself from it, in recognizing oneself from the start as distant, as the precessor’(Concept, 15).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finishing the reading, I can only conclude that Granata is concerned about photography in the sense that the photographer who took a ‘photograph of’ some object is taking it with an unconscious intent of shaping how that object relates to us or how it affects us. Therefore, the photo is not showing the object but an imitation of that object. She proposed an alternative way to show the realness of an object using and apply its characteristics with code in order to generate a new photo that more clearly represent that object.
