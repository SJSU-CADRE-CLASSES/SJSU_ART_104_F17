+In Yvette Granata’s ‘Photo of Lamprey’ to ‘Photo-Fictional Lamprey', the image of the lamprey' is compared to the living organism represented by the image.
The concept of a photograph is complex, with different meanings from different artists It is the is the capture of the light hitting the object, translated into hundreds of bits of data. It captures the texture, the the shadows, and thelines of of the object into a digital form.
The Google search of these delicate looking Lampreys gives a plethora of imagegs highlighting the dangerous teeth of the creature, bared in its still form in the image.
 And yet, it is not 'a Lamprey'. It is simply, thought this does not take away form its importance, an image of a lamprey. It is 'a photograph of'.
+The philosophy behind this contrast of content is difficult to grasp, even after class and class after class of lecture on the topic of what a photograph/image IS.
It is easy to call it a figment of fiction, but it still feels real to our eyes. It is visible and able to be assessed throug our eyes and mind, and to wrap my mind around the idea of it being 'fiction' in the normal, standard definition of the word,
is hard to a challenge to say the least.
